Cautions for PARTNER-N64/Win

The initial value of the IO address of the interface board that is set
in a PC is 0x320.  When the setting of the interface board is changed,
please open the EPTN64.CFG file in the install directory for PARTNER-N64
by the Editor, and set it to the IO address that changed the setting of
the port address.  

In the README.TXT and VERSION.TXT in the install directory,  the most
updated information and the supplementary information are found.
