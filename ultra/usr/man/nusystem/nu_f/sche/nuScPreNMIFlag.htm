This is a flag indicating whether or not a PRE NMI has been received.  The following bits are set to 1 by the scheduler. 
</P>

<ul>
<li>NU_SC_PRENMI_YET     
<br>All bits are 0 when no PRE NMI event has occurred.
<P>
<li>NU_SC_PRENMI_GET     
<br>When a PRE NMI event has been received
<P>
<li>NU_SC_BEFORE_RESET   
<br>This bit is set during a 0.5 second interval after  a PRE NMI event has been received. The bit must be set 2 frames before the end of this 0.5 second interval. Once this bit has been set, graphics tasks and audio tasks can no longer be executed.
