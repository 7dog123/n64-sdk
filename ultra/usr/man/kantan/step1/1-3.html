<H1>1.1.3 N64 Hardware and System Features</H1>

<H2>Hardware Features</H2>

<OL>
<LI>The CPU is fast (about 100 MIPS) and includes the following on-chip cache memory:<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-1.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=218 HEIGHT=96 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
<BR>
<LI>N64 doesn't require a special dedicated chip to process graphics and audio as Super NES does. N64 uses software to execute almost all processes.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-2.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=176 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
<LI>RDRAM main memory can be used by the entire system. Programmers are free to divide up the main memory into buffers (frame buffer, audio buffer, Z-buffer, heap, texture buffer, and so on) as appropriate for each game program. It is a unified memory system.<BR>
<BR> 
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-3.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=303 HEIGHT=180><BR><BR>
<LI>Almost all processes are executed by the CPU and RCP working together.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-4.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=273 HEIGHT=128 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
<LI>The RCP consists of two internal processors the RSP (Reality Signal Processor) and the RDP (Reality Display Processor), I/O Interface, and control logic.<BR>
<BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-5.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=382 HEIGHT=103 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
The RSP and RDP work together to execute GBI (Graphics Binary Interface) commands and render graphics into the frame buffer. The GBI commands are strung together into a specialized command list call the display list.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-6.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=238 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
The RSP also interprets ABI (Audio Binary Interface) commands and creates linear PCM data using the sampling rate specified by the audio buffer.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-7.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=373 HEIGHT=250 BORDER=0><BR>

<LI>The RSP interprets GBI and ABI commands by using software called microcode.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-8.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=388 HEIGHT=130 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
<LI>The image drawn in the frame buffer is transferred to the video DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) through DMA (direct memory access). The image becomes the TV image there in the video DAC.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-9.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=379 HEIGHT=223 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
<LI>The PCM data placed in the audio buffer is transferred to audio DAC through DMA. The audio becomes sound there in the audio DAC.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-10.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=414 HEIGHT=183 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
<LI>For faster processing, game programs are not executed on the N64 Game Pak directly. Instead they are loaded into RDRAM first.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-11.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=303 HEIGHT=242 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
<LI>Data coming from the Controller is read by way of the PIF chip as serial data. Similarly, data in the Controller Pak is also read and written by way of the PIF chip through the Controller as serial data.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-12.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=410 HEIGHT=191 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
<LI>The RDP creates the screen by using the Z-buffer (depth buffer) as shown in the following illustration. Note that this is a conceptual illustration only. In practice, the Z-buffer values range from -1.0 to 1.0.<BR>
<BR>

</UL>

<H2>System (Software) Features</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Game applications are executed in the multi-thread N64 Operating System.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-14.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=375 HEIGHT=205 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
<LI>Multi-thread programming provides the following advantages:<BR>
<BR>


<UL>
<LI>You can run independent processes on a single piece of hardware at the same time.
<LI>Threads provide a natural way to structure your program.
<LI>Thread synchronization is assured because the threads communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages.
</OL>


As a result, there are fewer bugs and debugging time is reduced.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-15.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=267 HEIGHT=205 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
<LI>Messages provide information throughput between threads.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-16.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=359 HEIGHT=181 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
<LI>Threads are executed according to their priority, not their actual position in the program code.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-17.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=304 HEIGHT=254 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
<LI>Threads that receive interrupt information messages execute interrupt processing.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-18.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=198 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
<LI>A high-priority thread called the Scheduler manages all the other threads. The Scheduler thread manages messages for the threads by using tasks or the VI retrace (the vertical synchronizing interrupt).<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/1-1-3-19.gif" ALIGN="bottom" WIDTH=226 HEIGHT=268 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
<LI>The CPU executes threads comprised of several processing units (function calls,
macros, and so on). The RSP in the RCP, on the other hand, executes processing units called tasks.<BR>
