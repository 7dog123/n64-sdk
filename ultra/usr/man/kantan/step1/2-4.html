<H1>1.2.4 RDRAM (N64 Main Memory)</H1>

<P>RDRAM is the N64 main memory. It provides a total of 4 megabytes by 9 bits of memory in two chips of 2 megabytes each.  The CPU and the RCP processing chips share all available RDRAM as shown in the following illustration:</P>

<H2>Features of RDRAM</H2>

<UL>
<LI>It provides 4 megabytes by 9 bits of space. (The 9th bit is used for anti-aliasing and Z-buffering.)
<LI>It consists of several banks in units of 1 megabyte by 9 bits. Each bank has separate active page registers.
<LI>The system clock operates at 250 MHz.
<LI>It can provide high-speed data transfer of 500 megabytes per second to read or write consecutive data per the RamBUS standard. (Note, however, that this high speed is not attainable for random access.)
<LI>The transfer speed is about 200 times that of Super NES.
<LI>It can be used simultaneously by the CPU, RSP, RDP, and the RCP I/O interfaces.
</UL>


<H2>RDRAM Block Definition</H2>

<P>As a game developer, you can map RDRAM as appropriate for each game application. Usually the following buffers and areas are specified in RDRAM:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Audio buffer
<LI>Frame buffer
<LI>Z-buffer
<LI>Vertex buffer
<LI>Texture buffer
<LI>Audio command list buffer
<LI>Display list buffer
<LI>Program area
<LI>Other data areas
</UL>
