<P>The game software is supplied by an N64 Game Pak and/or an N64 Disk Drive disk through the parallel interface. The N64 Disk Drive is connected to the Control Deck by way of the expansion slot located on the bottom of the N64 Control Deck. As you can see, up to four Controllers can be connected to the N64 Control Deck at any one time through the serial interface.</P>

<P>You can add a Controller Pak or a Rumble Pak to each Controller. The Controller Pak provides more data storage capacity as well as portability, and the Rumble Pak provides vibration to make the game seem more real to the game player.</P>
