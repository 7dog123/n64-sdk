<H1>1.2.2 CPU (Central Processing Unit)</H1>

<P>The N64 CPU is a very high-speed CPU with a clock speed of 93.75 MHz. Because an integer pipeline and a floating-point pipeline are shared, integer arithmetic and floating-point arithmetic are not processed simultaneously. However, floating-point arithmetic can be executed by the hardware.</P>

<H2>CPU Features</H2>

<P>The N64 CPU gives you all these features:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Belongs to the R4000 family of processors
<LI>Is more than 100 times the speed of NES
<LI>Provides an execution unit that equips the 64-bit register file for integer or floating-point arithmetic.
<LI>Provides a 16K-byte instruction cache on the CPU chip.
<LI>Provides a data cache that uses an 8K-byte write-back system on the CPU chip.
<LI>Provides a memory management unit that uses the high-speed translation lookaside buffer (TLB) to convert virtual addresses to physical addresses.
</UL>


<H2>TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)</H2>
<UL>
<LI>This is a register for mapping virtual addresses to physical addresses.
<LI>The TLB has 32 entries.  Each entry maps a virtual address onto the page of two physical addresses. 
<LI>Page addresses are variable and can be set independently in each entry.
</UL>

<H2>CPU Specifications</H2>

<P>Following are the N64 CPU specifications:</P>

<UL>
<LI>system clock is 93.75 MHz
<LI>bus width is 64 bits
<LI>instruction cache is 16K bytes
<LI>data cache is 8K bytes
</UL>
