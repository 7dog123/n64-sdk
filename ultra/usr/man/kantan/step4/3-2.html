<H1>4.3.2 The Development-Use 64DD</H1>

<P>The development-use 64DD does not have built-in DDROM. The special development-use IPL is located and used from an ordinary ROM cartridge address. This is different from the address in DDROM but has no effect on development.

<P>To access font and wave data in the same way it is accessed in DDROM on a consumer-use drive, you need the 64DD system's IPLROM cassette. The same contents stored in the DDROM of the consumer-use drive are stored on the board of this IPLROM cassette.
