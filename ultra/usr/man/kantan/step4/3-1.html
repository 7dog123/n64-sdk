<H1>4.3.1 The Development-Use Drive vs. the Consumer-Use Drive</H1>

<P>There are two types of 64DD drive: One for development use and the other for consumer use. Please note that these two types of drives have their own dedicated disks.

<P><B>The development-use drive:</B> The development-use 64DD utilizes development-use disks (blue disks), which are inserted in the blue bezel (disk insertion slot).

<P><B>The consumer-use drive:</B> The consumer-use 64DD utilizes mass-production disks (usually gray), which are inserted in the black bezel (disk insertion slot).

<P><B>Please make sure to use the right kind of disk in the right kind of drive.</B> The hardware of the two systems is different, and you can damage a drive if you insert the wrong kind of disk.

<P>After an application program has been completely debugged, it is written to a consumer-use disk by Nintendo.<BR>
