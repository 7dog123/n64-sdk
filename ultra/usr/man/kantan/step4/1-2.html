<H1>4.1.2 System Features</H1>

<H2>Hardware Features</H2>

<H3>Larger RAM Area</H3>

<P>64DD adds a 4M x 9bit (36Mbit) memory expansion pack to the N64 Control Deck's standard 4M x 9bit (36Mbit) of main memory. This expands N64 main memory to 8M x 9-bit (72M-bit).

<H3>High-Speed Data Transfers</H3>

<P>64DD boasts a maximum data transfer rate of 1MByte/sec, which is quick for disk media and about <B>5.4 times faster</B> than the CD-ROM drives used in other game machines.

<H3>Compact, Mass-Storage</H3>

<P>Although in outward appearance the disk is only a little larger than a floppy disk (100 x 100 x 10mm), it has a memory capacity of 64.45 MBytes, which is much larger than a floppy disk.

<H3>Writable</H3>

<P>The disk is not simply a medium for storing game programs, although it can be used in that way as a read-only medium.  It is also possible to designate separate read-only (ROM) and writable (RAM) areas on the same disk.

<P>Up to 38.44 MBytes can be designated as RAM on each disk, and this writable area can be used to store vast amounts of user data.

<H3>Battery-Backup Real-Time Clock</H3>

<P>64DD incorporates a battery-backup real-time clock. Since this clock operates even when the power is turned off, it is possible to reflect real time in games.

<H2>Software Features</H2>

<H3>Efficiently Managed File System</H3>

<P>Since the work of directly programming disk-control code can be vastly reduced by efficiently managing the 64DD's expanded RAM area, the Multi File System (MFS) and an MFS library are provided as Nintendo's recommended file system.</P>

<P>With MFS, data in the ROM area as well as the RAM area can be managed in file units.</P>

<H3>Special Functions Available for Disk Access</H3>

<P>The special Leo Library for 64DD is available as a low-level function library that is closer to the hardware than the MFS that controls the 64DD. The Leo Library is used for disk access by the MFS Library, which is a high-level function library.</P>

<P>An overview of the location of these libraries is illustrated below.</P>
