<H1>N64 3D Graphics</H1>

<P>Part 3 of this manual gives a very basic overview of 3D Graphics matrices, mathematics, and coordinate systems. It is the 3D graphics, more than any other single factor, that will sell your games and make your games compelling, so it is imperative that you know as much as possible about this subject.

<P>The topic of 3D graphics is covered in many books. This small section gives you just a taste of what you need to know. To learn more, please review a graphics textbook such as <I>Computer Graphics Principles and Practice</I>; 2nd ed.; by James D. Foley, Andries van Dam, Steven K. Feiner, John F. Hughes; published in 1996 by Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc.

<P>After reviewing this manual, you will have an easier time delving into the details provided in the <A HREF="../../pro-man/start/index.html" TARGET="_top">N64 Programming Manual</A> and the <A HREF="../../n64man/home.html" TARGET="_top">N64 Function Reference Manual</A>.</P>
