<H1>3.1.2 General 3D Graphics Process</H1>


<P>The basic 3D graphics process is a three-step process.

<H3>1. Create the model</H3><H3></H3>

<P>First of all, you need to create the data for the object you want to draw. In general, an object to be drawn in computer graphics is called a model and the set of coordinates and other data belonging to  a model is called model data. To create model data effectively, you can use any of the many available 3D graphic tools called 3D modelers.

<P>You can also create model data on graph paper by hand, and then feed it into a computer. However, this method is complicated and requires a lot of work, so it isn't a good way to create a large model.</P>

<H3>2. Convert the model data</H3>

<P>Next, you need to convert the model data, and place it in the virtual three-dimensional space of the computer. Then provide for the conversion calculations to show rotation, scale, movement, lighting, perspective, and so on.  As a result of the conversion calculations, you can display a model that will be viewed from all directions. Moreover, it will be a solid image that has depth as shown by the lighting visual effects.</P>

<H3>3. Display the model on the TV screen</H3>

<P>Finally, you need to send the model data in the virtual three-dimensional space of the computer  to the TV screen by way of various software and hardware processes.  Ultimately, when the converted model is displayed on a two-dimensional TV screen, the depth (z axis) information is no longer needed. Pixels (picture elements) are displayed on the screen.</P>
