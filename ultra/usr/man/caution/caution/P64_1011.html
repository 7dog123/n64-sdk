<h3>10-11  Reliability of Data (Required)</h3>

<b>Caution</b><br>
Because the reliability of data contained in a Controller Pak can't be verified by N64 hardware or the N64 OS/Library, the reliability of this data must be verified by the game.

<p>
<b>Discussion</b><br>
Data storage cannot be assured if power is interrupted or if the Controller Pak
is removed during write access.

<p>
Examples of measures to prevent destruction of back-up data are:

<ol>
<li>Detection of errors ... Checksum / CRC.
<li>Detection of abnormal data by the program.
<li>Check the Controller Pak for brand new data or destroyed data.
<li>Writing completion flag.
<li>Back up the saved data (write it to two locations).
</ol>
