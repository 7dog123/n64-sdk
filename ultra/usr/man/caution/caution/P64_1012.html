<h3>10-12  Software Access to Controller Pak (Required)</h3>

<b>Caution</b><br>
If software is not  designed to use a Controller Pak, ensure that it will not try to write to a Controller Pak which happens to be installed in the Controller.

<p>
<b>Discussion</b><br>
If software that is not intended to be used with a Controller Pak is allowed to write to a Controller Pak, it will cause unexpected data to be written to the Controller Pak.  Saved data created by other games could be destroyed.
