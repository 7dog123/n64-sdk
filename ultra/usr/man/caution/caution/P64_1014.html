<h3>10-14  Multi-note Application (Required)</h3>

<b>Caution</b><br>
When using a multi-note application, the base note and the additional note must have identical note names.  (Each note is distinguished by the note extension.)  Control information for the note must be contained in each note. 

<p>
<b>Discussion</b><br>
The situation must be avoided where any note can be deleted by the user, but once that note is deleted, the remaining notes cannot be used.
