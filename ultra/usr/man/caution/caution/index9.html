<li><a href="#1">9-1  Safety Frame Size (Recommended)</a>

<a name="1"></a><h3>9-1  Safety Frame Size (Recommended)</h3>

<b>Caution</b><br>
Anticipate that a user's TV will not display data on the edge of the TV screen.  Important information (data) should be displayed in a manner which avoids the edge of the TV screen.

<p>
<b>Discussion</b><br>
Some TVs cannot display data on the edge of the TV screen.  For specific values
of the safe frame setting on various televisions, refer to Developer News 1.3, Section 3:  <a href="../../developerNews/news-03-3.html">Safe Frame</a>.  Determine the location of the displayed information after considering the importance of the message.

<a name="2"></a><h3>9-2  Excessive Flicker (Recommended)</h3>

<b>Caution</b><br>
It is recommended that developers avoid unnecessary flickering or flashing on the screen.

<p>
<b>Discussion</b><br>
Visually-induced seizures, seizures precipitated by flashing lights and patterns, may occur in some individuals who have a pre-existing susceptibility called photo- or pattern sensitivity.  While photo- and pattern sensitivity in the general population are extremely rare, persons with either of these conditions may experience seizures as a result of watching some kinds of television pictures or playing certain video games.  Therefore, we suggest avoiding excess flickering or flashing.

<a name="3"></a><h3>9-3  Screen Boundaries (Recommended)</h3>

<b>Caution</b><br>
Data which exists directly outside of the frame buffer boundaries should not appear on the television screen.

<p>
<b>Discussion</b><br>
Screen boundaries vary from one TV to another.  If data directly adjacent to the frame buffer is not clipped by the Video DAC, some televisions may display the data as lines of &quot;static&quot;, which appear at the top or bottom of the screen.

<p>
Using standard video modes, this problem should not appear.  However, if a video mode has been altered in any way, the boundaries of the frame buffer display should be checked to ensure that no extra data is being displayed outside of the intended region.
