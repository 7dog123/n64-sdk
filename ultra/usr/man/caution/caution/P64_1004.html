<h3>10-4  Exchanging Controller Pak (Required)</h3>

<b>Caution</b><br>
If a Controller Pak is removed and inserted, or Controller Pak(s) are exchanged during game play, ensure that appropriate processes within the game function as intended after Controller Pak(s) are exchanged.

<p>
<b>Discussion</b><br>
A user might remove the Controller Pak with the power on, although Nintendo does not recommend this.  It is recommended that an appropriate message is displayed while saving or restoring data to the Controller Pak.  If the Controller Pak is removed while read/write access is performed, the data will be undefined.
