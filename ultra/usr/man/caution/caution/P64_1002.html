<h3>10-2  Treatment of Saved Data (Required)</h3>

<b>Caution</b><br>
When a game requires a Controller Pak to save data, the game must check for a Controller Pak before starting game play.  If a Controller Pak is not found, a message stating &quot;No Controller Pak.  The game cannot be saved.&quot; must be displayed.

<p>
<b>Discussion</b><br>
To prevent a situation where important data cannot be read from or written to a Controller Pak, the programmer should try to design the game program so that the game can be played without a Controller Pak.
