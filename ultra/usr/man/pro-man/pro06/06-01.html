The Nintendo 64 system runs under a small, real-time, preemptive kernel. It is supplied as a set of run-time library functions, so that only those portions that are actually used are included in the game’s run-time image. In the remainder of this document, it is referred to as the operating system, although it is so minimal that it has not been given an official name.
<P>
The kernel can be considered as being layered into core functionality and higher-level system services, as illustrated in the following figure.

<P>
<i>Threads, messages, events,</i> and <i>raw I/O</i> compose the kernel of the Nintendo 64 operating system. Upon this base are built some additional services that facilitate access to the raw hardware.
<P>
In this introductory section, a brief overview of these services will be provided.
