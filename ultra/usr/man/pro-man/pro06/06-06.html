The Nintendo 64 system spends a good deal of its time performing I/O operations. The operating system provides an optimized I/O interface layer that directly communicates with the hardware. Some of these interfaces include:
<ul>
<li>VI — the video interface  
<br>The interface routines communicate with a video manager system thread, called the VI/Timer manager. This thread receives all vertical retrace interrupts and programs the video hardware. In addition, it also receives all counter interrupt messages and implements timer services.
<p>
<li>PI — the peripheral interface
<br>The PI also has an associated I/O manager thread, the PI manager. It manages access to the ROM cartridge so that two threads do not attempt to DMA from ROM to RAM at the same time.
<p>
<li>AI — the audio interface
<br>This interface programs the audio hardware to output the desired sample rate and manages access to the audio data buffer.
<p>
<li>DP — the RDP interface
<br>It is mostly of interest because it has an associated system event when a DP operation is complete.
<p>
<li>Cont — the controller interface
<br>This interface resets, detects, obtains status, queries and reads data from the game controllers.</ul>
