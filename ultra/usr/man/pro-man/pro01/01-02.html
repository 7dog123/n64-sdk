The Nintendo 64 development software image is not the only software required for development. Your Indy workstation must also contain the following 5.3 products:

<ul>
<li>dev
<li>c_dev
<li>compiler_dev
<li>gl_dev
<li>CaseVision, version 2.4
<li>WorkShop, version 2.4
</ul>

<P>
Three products are bundled with the Nintendo 64 development software:
<ul>
<li>GameShop
<li>ultra
<li>dmedia_eoe (version 5.5)
</ul>

<P>
<b>Note:</b> Casevision and Workshop need to be installed before Gameshop.  Workshop needs to be version 2.4 or earlier.

<b>READMEs and Release Notes</b>
<br>
After installing the software, you will find a collection of sample demonstration applications in /usr/src/PR. The  README_DEMOS file describes each of the applications' key features. You will also find the release notes in /usr/src/PR/relnotes. The release notes summarizes the differences from the last release and includes a  discussion of the various bugs, workarounds and caveats of the system.

<b>Other Sources</b>
<br>
In the /usr/src/PR/assets directory, you will find the source files for building the general MIDI bank. An initial complete general MIDI bank was created for testing purposes. For a game, we assume that you will gut the bank down to include only those instrument and sounds that you need. Therefore, this directory gives you a starting point to do that.

<P>
In the /usr/src/PR/libultra directory you will find portions of the Nintendo 64 system library code (libultra.a). This code is supplied to give a starting point on writing your own custom versions of these sub components. However, these sources require extensive SGI source tree build environment tools to actually build. Therefore, only the non -buildable sources are shipped currently.

<p>

<b>Executables</b>
<br>
The first piece of software you will need to use is <i>gload</i>. This program downloads the ROM image onto the Nintendo 64 development board and starts execution. Soon after, you will need to use <i>dbgif</i> and <i>gvd</i> to debug your program.

<ul>
<li>/usr/sbin/gload
<P>
<li>/usr/sbin/dbgif
<P>
<li>/usr/sbin/gvd
</ul>

<P>
There are also conversion tools that help in converting data into Nintendo 64 format. For example, <i>flt2c</i> converts a MultiGen database into a C data structure that can be compiled into binary form. Most of these tools reside in /usr/sbin but some are supplied in source form in /usr/src/PR/conv.  Keep in mind that these are templates for your own custom database conversion tools. We cannot possibly address the needs of all developers.

<b>Installing the N64 Emulator Software</b>
<br>
Please follow the procedure shown below to install the N64 Emulation Software. 
<ol>
<li>Expand the contents of the DAT tape. 
<P>
<li>Insert the DAT tape and input &quot;tar xv&quot; in the appropriate directory. 
<br>A directory containing the version name will be created under that directory. 
<P>
<li>Start Software Manager.
<P>
<li>Check to make sure the necessary <a target="main" href="../pro01/01-02.html#soft">software applications</a> are installed.
<P>
<li>Auto-install the IRIS provided software and ProDev/WorkShop. 
</ol>

<ul>
<ul type="a.">
<li>Select custom install.
<P>
<li>Install the Graphics Library Image Tools that are located in the Execution Environment 2 sub-directory on the  IRIX5.3 CD.
</ul></ul>

<P>
<ol start="6">
<li>Install the emulator software. 
<P>
<li>In Software Manager, specify a version name for the directory name and select custom install. Install the following applications:</ol>

<ul><ul>
<li>GameShop
<li>ultra
<li>dmedia_eoe (version 5.5)
</ul></ul>
<P>
If the installation is unsuccessful, check to make sure that the 5.3 software products are installed correctly, try installing the emulator software again.
