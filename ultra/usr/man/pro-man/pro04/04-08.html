<b>WorkShop Debugger Heritage</b>
<BR>
The GameShop debugger (gvd) derived its heritage from the Silicon Graphics WorkShop application development tools. It is a source level windowing debugger environment that enables debugging of both the CPU and RSP software.
<P>

<b>Debugger Components</b>
<br>
The debugger is actually composed of several different components shown in Figure 4.8.1, below.
<P>
There are two debugging paths. The first path is a C source level windowing debugger, gvd, which has most of the features of common multi-threaded debuggers. It talks to dbgif, which interfaces to the rmon debug thread through the Nintendo 64 device driver in IRIX.
<P>
The second path is the popular printf traces within the application. rmonPrintf() display the messages in the shell that executed dbgif.

<P>

The rmon debugger thread is actually a high-priority thread in the game application and uses many operating system resources. Therefore, the debugger and rmonPrintf cannot be used to debug system-level code.
