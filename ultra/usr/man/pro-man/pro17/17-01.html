<P>
<font face="arial" size="-1" color="#000000">
The basic process for generating, and playing audio can be summed up by the following steps.

<ol>
<li>Create and initialize the necessary resources. (Typically, an audio heap, a synthesizer, and a player)
<P>
<li>Repeatedly make calls to alAudioFrame to generate the audio task lists.
<P>
<li>Execute these audio tasks lists on the RSP.
<P>
<li>Set the output DAC’s to point to the audio output, with a call to osAiSetNextBuffer().
</ol>

<P>
The creation and initialization of the necessary resources is somewhat dependent on your applications needs, but typically you will need to take the following steps.
<ol>
<li>Create an audio heap with a call to alHeapInit.
<P>
<li>Set the hardware output frequency with a call to osAiSetFrequency.
<P>
<li>Create a synthesizer with a call to alInit(). (alInit will require that you have a callback routine to initialize the audio dma structures)
<P>
<li>Create message queues for receiving signals that allow you to time your audio processing.
<P>
<li>Create a player, (such as a sound player or sequence player) to sign into the synthesizer. 
<P>
<li>Initialize the resources specific to the player(s) that you have created.
