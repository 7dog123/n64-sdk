<b><font face="arial" color="#29296b">Display List Processing</font></b>

<P>
<font face="arial" size="-1" color="#000000">
Understanding the basics of the RSP display list processing is necessary to construct efficient, compact display lists for an application.
<P>
The display list (or command list) can be thought of as a hierarchical structure, up to 10 levels deep. A display list may contain a pointer to another display list, and so on. The RSP processes the display list using a stack, pushing and popping the current display list pointer.
<P>
For animation, it will be desirable to “double-buffer” parts of the display list; rendering one frame while the data for the next frame is updated. In this case, only the minimum amount of data need be duplicated; only the data which will change for each frame. Swapping between doubled buffers is efficiently done by changing the segment base addresses (and organizing your display list appropriately).
<P>
During computation by the RSP, all display lists and their data must remain in the same location until the RSP is finished. This sounds obvious, but is a very common bug, usually the result of incorrect usage of double-buffering techniques. In addition, if the RSP task is interrupted (please see <a target="main" href="../pro08/08-08.html#01">“Section 8.8, "Signal Processor (SP) Functions”</a>), all of the data must remain in the same location when/if the task is restarted.

<b>Connecting Display Lists</b>
<br>
Hierarchical display list connection can be made with the <i>gsSPDisplayList()</i>  macro. The current display list location is pushed on the display list stack and processing begins with the new display list.

<b>Branching Display Lists</b>
<br>
A display list branch without a push allows you to “chain” together fragments of display lists for more efficient memory utilization.
<P>
<b>Table 2</b> &nbsp;gsSPBranchList(Gfx *dl)
<br>
<table border=1 cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3" width="60%">
<tr>
<td width=30%><font face="arial" size="-1"><b>Parameter</td>
<td width=70%><font face="arial" size="-1"><b>Values</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=30%><font face="arial" size="-1">dl</td>
<td width=70%><font face="arial" size="-1">pointer to the display list to attach</td>
</tr></table>

<b>Ending Display Lists</b>
<br>
All display lists must terminate with an “end” command.
<P>
<b>Table 3</b> &nbsp;gsSPEndDisplayList(void)
<br>
<table border=1 cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3" width="60%">
<tr>
<td width=30%><font face="arial" size="-1"><b>Parameter</td>
<td width=70%><font face="arial" size="-1"><b>Values</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=30%><font face="arial" size="-1">none</td>
<td width=70%><font face="arial" size="-1">none</td>
</tr></table>

<b>A Few Words About Optimal Display Lists</b>
<br>
The display list processor running on the RSP caches display list commands in groups of about 32. This means the optimal display list size is a multiple of 32. A display list of 33 commands (or 65, etc.) would require the display list cache to be refilled during processing, possibly causing a wait state (depending on the DMA engine activity). Obviously not all display lists can keep the list processor running 100% optimally, but it is something to keep in mind when tuning your application.
<P>
Another form of display lists which cause less than optimal processing are display lists that look like the following:
<P>
<table border=0 align="center">
<tr><td>
<img border=0 align="center" src="../pro11/gif/f11-01-00.gif"></tr></td></table>
<P>
Since the display list engine is stack-based, a display list that has lots of unnecessary indirect pointers will cause lots of unnecessary pushes and pops, which do have a cost.
<P>
Constructs like this are unavoidable at times, for example, when sharing geometries among objects. Therefore, when you have a choice try not to group indirect display list pointers together.
