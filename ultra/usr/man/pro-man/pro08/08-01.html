The Input/Output (I/O) subsystem exists on most operating systems for three main reasons:
<ol> 
<li>to hide device-specific details in device drivers through which the operating system transfers data and control
<P>
<li>to provide a fair and safe access scheme to the devices, since most of them are shared resources
<P>
<li>to provide a consistent, uniform, and flexible interface to all devices, allowing programs to reference devices by name and perform high-level operations without knowing the device configuration.</ol>
<P>
Usually, the I/O software is structured in layers:

<ul>
<li>device-independent system interface
<li>device drivers
<li>interrupt handlers
</ul>
<P>
The interrupt handler is mainly responsible for waking up a device driver after an I/O operation completes. The device driver performs device-specific operations, such as setting up registers for DMA and checking device status. The device-independent system interface provides a uniform interface to user-level software and common I/O functions (that is, protection, blocking, buffering) that can be performed across different devices. 
<P>
For the RCP, there are two modes of I/O operations:
<ul>
<li>DMA provides a minimum of 64-bit transfer between the RDRAM and any of the devices
<P>
<li>IO provides a 32-bit transfer between the CPU and any of the devices</ul>

<P>
The RCP consists of the following major devices and interfaces (see <a target="main" href="../pro08/08-01.html#fig8.1">Figure 8.1.1 below</a>):
<ul>
<li>Reality Signal Processor (RSP)
<br>This internal processor supports both DMA and IO operations between RDRAM and I/Dmem addresses.
<P>
<li>Reality Display Processor (RDP)
<br>This internal processor supports only DMA from either RDRAM or Dmem addresses to its internal buffer.
<P>
<li>Video Interface (VI)
<br>This write-only interface connects to the video DAC. It supports only DMA from RDRAM to a specific video buffer address and allows you to change video modes and configurations.
<P>
<li>Audio Interface (AI)
<br>This write-only interface connects to the audio DAC. It supports only DMA from RDRAM to a specific audio buffer address and allows you to set the audio frequency.
<P>
<li>Peripheral Interface (PI)
<br>This read-write interface connects to the ROM cartridge and other mass storage devices. It supports DMA as well as IO Read/Write to ROM addresses.
<P>
<li>Serial Interface (SI)
<br>This read-write module interfaces to the PIF, which connects to the game controller and modem devices. It supports DMA as well as IO Read/Write to PIF RAM addresses.
