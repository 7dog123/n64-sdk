<b><font face="arial" color="#29296b">Using the Region Allocation Routines</font></b>

<P>
<font face="arial" size="-1" color="#000000">
Previous examples were primarily concerned with static memory allocation; many applications may find it necessary to do some form of dynamic allocation. For situations where the allocation is always done in fixed size chunks, a family of region allocation routines are provided. These routines will carve up a larger buffer into fixed some memory regions that are managed by the library. The routines of interest are:
<ul>
<li>osCreateRegion<br>
This function initializes an allocation arena given a memory address, size, and alignment.
<P>
<li>osMalloc<br>
This function allocates and returns the address to a single fixed sized and properly aligned buffer from a given region. This function will fail and return NULL is there is no available free buffer in the region.
<P>
<li>osFree<br>
This routine returns a previously allocated buffer to the given region pool.
<P>
<li>osGetRegionBufCount<br>
This function returns the total number of buffers in the region. 
<P>
<li>osGetRegionBufSize<br>
This function returns the actual buffer size, after having been possibly padded to the given alignment.
</ul>
<P>
The following code sample creates a region, allocates a buffer, and then frees it.
<pre><font face="courier" size=3>void *region;
        char regionMemory[REGION_SIZE];
        u64 *buffer;

        region = osCreateRegion(regionMemory,
                               sizeof(regionMemory),
                               BUFFER_SIZE, OS_RG_ALIGN_16B);
        buffer = osMalloc(region);
 
        /* do some work that uses ‘buffer’ */

        osFree(region, buffer);
</pre></font>
<P>
Incidentally, if the fixed size regions are intended to hold entire segments, the maxsize keyword of the makerom specification file may be of interest. See <a target="_top" href="../pro09/index9.6.html"><i>makerom(1P)</i></a> for details.
