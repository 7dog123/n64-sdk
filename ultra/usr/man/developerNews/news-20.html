<h2>Problems with 64DD Disk Formatting</h2>
<h3>1. Summary</h3>
<p>
We have discovered that some of the development disks (blue disks) included 
with the N64DD Development System have been formatted incorrectly.  Disks 
with this problem will operate differently from normal disks when they are 
read while not being used.  Error 23 will occur when normal disks are read 
while not being used, but problem disks will hang up an application.
<p>
The problem disks work the same as normal disks, and once they are 
written using the development tools, they will work without problems 
as long as they are used normally.  
<p>
However, some disks can have unused portions different from normal disks, 
even once they have been used.  Problems may arise when you attempt to 
use this portion in the future.
<p>
To counter this problem, determine whether your disks have the problem, 
and if so, use the dn (disk normalizer) tool to correct the formatting.  
We apologize for the inconvenience.
<p>
The dn tool rewrites portions of the disk that are unrelated to the user 
area.  If you use it on a disk that contains important programs or data, 
the contents will not be deleted.  Please use the tool freely.

<h3>2. Identifying Normal and Problem Disks</h3>
<p>
Normal and problem disks can be identified by the number printed on the 
front of the disk (where the index label is attached).  Disks with the 
following numbers were formatted incorrectly:

<ul> 
197-8-**-01 <br>
197-9-**-01 
</ul>

Identification will be difficult if a label has already been applied.  In 
such cases it is not necessary to peel the label off to identify the disk.  
The dn tool can automatically determine whether or not a disk is a problem 
disk, so is not crucial that you be able to identify the disk by its 
appearance.

<h3>3. About the "dn" Tool</h3>
<p>
dn operates on the N64 and is stored in /usr/lib/PR/ when Development 
Environment 2.0J is installed.  Because it is a N64 program, it can be 
executed by transferring it to the emulation ROM using a tool such as 
PARTNER, or by burning it into the flash ROM.
<p>
The procedure for executing dn with PARTNER-PC is shown below (for the 
Partner-NW version, substitute /usr/lib/PR/dn for c:\ultra\usr\PR\lib\dn)

<ul>
>rd c:\ultra\usr\PR\lib\dn, 0xb0000000 <br>
>reset <br>
>g 
</ul>

dn is already in the format executed by makemask, so it can be directly 
burned into the flash ROM when executing by that method.  dn will check the 
inserted disk and process it if there is a problem.  When processing is 
finished, the message "REWORK COMPLETE" will be displayed.  If the disk is 
normal, nothing will be done.  In this case, the message "NO PROBLEM" will 
be displayed.  Once processing is finished, the disk will be correctly
formatted.  Once one disk is processed, the prompt "REPLACE DISK" will be 
displayed.  Processing can be continued for the next disk by inserting 
another disk.

<h3>4. FAQ</h3>
<p>
<b>Q1.  I can't tell if the disks I've got are normal.</b>
<p>
A1.  If the inserted disk is normal, dn won't do anything.  Consequently, 
if you're not sure whether the disk is normal or not, try running 
dn with the disk.
<p>
<b>Q2.  I have a problem disk, but I can't remember if I've already run dn 
or not.</b>
<p>
A2.  dn can be executed any number of times.  If you don't know whether or 
not you've already done it, run dn again just to make sure.  If dn has 
already been run for that disk, it will be determined to be normal on the 
second and subsequent tries, and dn will complete processing without doing 
anything.
<p>
<b>Q3.  I have a disk on which I've already written important programs and 
data.  Won't they be deleted if I run dn?</b>
<p>
A3.  It's OK!  Since dn rewrites the portions which are unrelated to the user 
area, none of your content will be deleted, even if you run dn on a disk that 
has already been used.
<p>
<b>Q4.  Does this mean that I could run dn on all of my disks just to make 
sure?</b>
<p>
A4.  Yes.  It only takes a moment to run dn and you can process multiple 
disks, one right after the other.  It can be used on normal disks without 
any problem, and important programs and data which have already been written 
will not be deleted.  If it is difficult to tell the normal disks from the 
problem disks, don't hesitate to run dn on all of your disks.
