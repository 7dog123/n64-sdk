<h2>EEPROM (Electrical Erasable Programmable ROM)</h2>
The EEPROM installed within some Nintendo 64 Game Pak(s) is a 512-byte 
(64 words x 64 bits) EEPROM. It contains a circuit for communication with 
the Nintendo 64 Control Deck's RCP serial interface.

<h3>Data Reliability</h3>
Each EEPROM address 0~63 can normally be over-written around 100,000 times. 
Beyond this point, memory cell deterioration may prevent data from being 
written normally.  Data can safely be stored on a EEPROM for up to ten 
years. However, if no new data have been written, the memory cells' charge 
gradually dies and data may not be readable beyond this period.  Thus, it is 
important to include check sum and parity bit data in order to check data 
reliability.

<h3>Precautions when Writing Data</h3>
When writing data (<a target=top href="../n64man/os/osEepromWrite.html">osEepromWrite</a>), there is a wait of approximately 15 msec 
between the interface circuit's reception of the write command and completion 
of data being written to the memory cells. If a second osEepromWrite is 
called during this period, the program will go into a needless "read status" 
polling loop inside the function until the first write command is completed.  
Therefore, when performing consecutive writes, more than 15 msec must be 
allowed between the completion of one write command and execution of the next 
write command.
<p>
The command <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osEepromLongWrite.html">osEepromLongWrite</a> uses the CPU timer to create the required 15 
msec interval. The timer is set to interrupt after 15 msec, while the thread 
that called the function goes to the wait status.

<h3>Related Commands</h3>

<font face="courier">s32 <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osEepromProbe.html">osEepromProbe</a>(OSMesgQueue *mq)</font>
<p>
This command checks for the presence of EEPROM. EEPROM is present if the 
returned value is 1 and absent if the returned value is 0.  0 will also be 
returned when a hardware error occurs (in the communication path).
<p>

<font face="courier">s32 <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osEepromWrite.html">osEepromWrite</a>(OSMesgQueue *mq, u8 address, u8 *buffer)</font>
<p>
This command writes 8 bytes of data to the EEPROM address (0~63).  If the 
write command has been properly sent to the interface circuit, a value of 0 
is returned.  If the address is not 0~63,  a value of -1 is returned. If 
there is no EEPROM (due to trouble in the communication path) or the 
interface circuit has not responded (CONT_NO_RESPONSE_ERROR), a value of 8 
is returned.
<p>

<font face="courier">s32 <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osEepromRead.html">osEepromRead</a>(OSMesgQueue *mq, u8 address, u8 *buffer)</font>
<p>
This command reads 8 bytes of data from the EEPROM address (0~63).  If the 
data have been properly read (no error in the communication path), a value 
of 0 is returned. If the address is not 0~63, a value of -1 is returned. If 
there is no EEPROM (due to trouble in the communication path) or the 
interface circuit has not responded (CONT_NO_RESPONSE_ERROR),  a value of 8 
is returned.
<p>

<font face="courier">s32 <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osEepromLongWrite.html">osEepromLongWrite</a>(OSMesgQueue *mq, u8 address, u8 *buffer, int length)</font>
<p>
This command writes 8 ( "length" bytes of successive data to the EEPROM 
address (0~63).  Actually, it merely calls up osEepromWrite "length" times 
as a part of the function.  There is a 15 msec wait using the CPU timer, 
however, for each write function.  As with osEepromWrite, a value of 0 is 
returned if all write commands ("length" times worth) are sent to the 
interface circuit.  If the address is not 0~63,  a value of -1 is returned.  
If there is no EEPROM (due to trouble in the communication path) or the 
interface circuit has not responded (CONT_NO_RESPONSE_ERROR), a value of 8 
is returned.
<p>

<font face="courier">s32 <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osEepromLongRead.html">osEepromLongRead</a>(OSMesgQueue *mq, u8 address, u8 *buffer, int length)</font>
<p>
This command reads 8 x "length" bytes of successive data to the EEPROM 
address (0~63).  Actually, it merely calls up <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osEepromRead.html">osEepromRead</a> "length" times 
as a part of the function. The return values are the same as for sEepromRead,
where a value of 0 is returned if all data ("length" times worth) have been 
properly read.  If the address is not 0~63, a value of -1 is returned. If 
there is no EEPROM (due to trouble in the communication path) or the 
interface circuit has not responded (CONT_NO_RESPONSE_ERROR), a value of 8 
is returned.
