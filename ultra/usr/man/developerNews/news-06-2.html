<h2>Controller Pak Write Enable Pin</h2>

If the Controller Pak RAM chip has a damaged WRITE ENABLE pin, data cannot 
be written to the Controller Pak.  This error condition will not be detected 
by <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osPfsInit.html">osPfsInit()</a>, <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osPfsChecker.html">osPfsChecker()</a>, or <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osPfsAllocateFile.html">osPfsAllocateFile()</a>.  It will return a value of 
PFS_ERR_INVALID from <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osPfsFindFile.html">osPfsFindFile()</a>.  So developers must verify that all osPfsFindFile() calls are successful.

<p>
The verification of a successful osPfsFindFile() should be performed during 
initial power-up, or whenever osPfsInit() is called. Waiting until data is 
actually written to the Controller Pak may be too late for the consumer 
(i.e., the consumer has already played the game up to the save point and 
THEN finds out that the Controller Pak is defective). If this verification is 
unsuccessful, the message "Damaged Controller Pak.  Game cannot be saved." 
must be displayed on the screen before game play begins.

<p>
The developer may modify a standard Controller Pak, if desired, in order to 
test this function.  Cut the trace from pin 27 of U2 (SRAM) in the Controller 
Pak to be used for testing.
