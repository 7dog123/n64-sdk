<a name="tip1"></a><h3>Note: Regarding NMI Reset</h3>

A problem was found that caused the application to halt when the reset 
button is pressed when the n_audio micro code is used with MPAL. This 
occurs if the application is re-started without first initializing the RSP 
program counter (PC). To fix this problem, we have added the following 
function into this patch:

<p>
<tt>
s32 osAfterPreNMI(void);
</tt>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initializes the RSP program counter (PC).

<p>
Explanation:

<p>
When the application receives a pre-NMI event, halt all RSP tasks and 
then call this function.

<p>
If the function call is successful, 0 is returned. If the RSP is active, 
the call fails and -1 is returned. In this case, wait for the executing 
RSP task to end and then call the function again.

<p>
When a pre-NMI event arrives, the application must halt GFX tasks and 
audio tasks. At the time that a pre-NMI event is received, confirm that 
the executing RSP task has ended and that no new RSP task has begun, and 
then call the osAfterPreNMI() function.

<p>
Please call the osAfterPreNMI() function whenever a pre-NMI event is 
received, even if you are using some mode other than MPAL (NTSC etc.).

<a name="tip2"></a><h3>Note: Timing of the osAiSetFrequency() function</h3>

A bug was found that produces a funny noise after the power is turned on 
to N64 and before playback of sounds begins.

<p>
This is an N64 hardware problem. When more than around 0.5 second elapses 
between the time that the power is turned on to N64 and the time that the 
osAiSetFrequency() function is called, then this noise will be produced when 
the function is called.

<p>
To avoid this noise, please call osAiSetFrequency() right after startup. 
However, note that osAiSetFrequency() must not be called until after the 
osInitialize() function has been called. In general, osInitialize() is the 
first function called in an N64 application. Therefore, we strongly 
recommend that you call osAiSetFrequency() immediately after calling the 
osInitialize() function.

<p>
Even if you can not follow the above recommendation, please make sure to 
call the osAiSetFrequency() function within 0.5 second after calling 
osInitialize().
