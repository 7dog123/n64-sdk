<h2>N64 Audio Tuning Guide</h2>
<h3>Speed Upgrades</h3>
<p>
Please optimize CPU to minimize the RSP task list.
<p>

<u>Step 1. Basics</u>
<ol type=A>
<li>Reduce pitch conversion as much as possible. Although no one method is 
preferred over another, where necessary, convert in a manner that will 
change the pitch slowly.
<li>Improve cache effectiveness by increasing the size of the DMA buffer. 
Reducing the number of revolutions in a large DMA is decidedly more effective 
than using numerous smaller DMAs.
<li>The effects should not be too elaborate (e.g., echo filter processing, 
reverb).
</ol>

<u>Step 2. Using SGI sound and sequence players</u>
<ol type=A>
<li>Do not use pitch bends very often, and do not use them close together.
<li>Do not use detailed fade-ins and fade-outs.
<li>Do not sound a continuous string of short musical tones. These three 
(A~C) involve numerous pitch and volume conversions that require many task 
lists and lengthy RSP processing.
<li>Make the release time as short as possible. This pertains to B. above. 
A short release time is preferred to avoid wasting physical voices.
<li>Do not create the percussion installment using a key map. Searching for 
waveform data allocated in the map takes too much time.
</ol>

<u>Step 3. Using customized players</u>
<p>
Creating Synthesizer Drivers
<ol type=A>
<li>Do not rewrite unchanged parameters. This will reduce calculation time. 
However, enough additional RAM is necessary.
<li>Synchronize the timing of parameter changes. This shortens the task lists.
<li>Make the callback intervals uniform. (Sacrifice the time base.)
<li>Select a value that does not cause variance in the number of a player's 
callback revolutions during 1 frame. Perform C and D to avoid detailed 
processing during a short time.
<li>To the greatest extent possible, execute voice management yourself. Make 
the CPU, not the driver, execute voice allocation from virtual to physical 
voices.
</ol>

<u>Step 4. Acceleration through coordinated operation with graphics</u>
<ol type=A>
<li>By using a RDRAM FIFO buffered microcode, the RSP wait time is used more 
effectively. Usually, the RSP processing time is shorter than the RDP 
processing time.
<li>Create Audio using 2 frames. If there are 30 game frames per second or 
less, audio processing time is reduced by doubling all of the buffers.
</ol>


<h3>Required RAM upgrades</h3>

<u>Step 1. Make reductions to current state</u>
<ol type=A>
<li>Reduce the waveform cache (DMA buffer) to its minimum. This reduces CPU 
speed.
<li>Reduce the number of ADPCM prediction factors. Do this when using the 
<a target=top href="../n64man/tools/tabledesign.html">tabledesign</a> tool.
<li>Minimize the amount of RAM used by loading the minimum required data at 
each frame instead of loading the data for several frames at one time.
</ol>

<u>Step 2. When creating player types yourself</u>
<ol type=A>
<li>Customize bank file formats. As long as the ALWave Table structure exists 
in the synthesizer driver, any format will do.
<li>Customize the sequence format. Compressing the SGI compact sequence 
player format is best.
<li>Convert two players' functions into one. Separate sound and sequence 
players are not necessary.
</ol>

<u>Step 3. Selecting optimum sampling rate</u>
<p>
The RSP can process a maximum of 160 samples per frame. If the maximum number 
of samples to be processed per frame is slightly smaller than a multiple of 
160, the command list can be shortened and the overhead that is needed by 
RSP processing may be kept to a minimum.
<p>
If, for example, 640 samples are required to be processed, the command list 
is divided into 4 processes (frames) of 160 samples each (160 x 4 = 640). 
Therefore, the RSP processes 4 times and there is no waste in the process.
<p>
If on the other hand 650 samples are required and the command list is divided 
into 5 processes of 160, 160, 160, 160, and 10 samples, the RSP must process 
5 times. The last process occurs for only 10 samples. This is a waste of 
processing time.
<p>
For example, when RSP processing uses three subframes, the following results are obtained.
<p>
<blockquote>
    160[samples] x 3[subframes] x 60[frames] = 28800[Hz]
</blockquote>
<p>
If approximately 27 KHz is selected, the RSP performs 3 processes of 160, 
160, and 131 samples. The command list buffer can be shortened and the waste 
of processing time is held to a minimum. However, the user must customize the 
audio player and adjust the callback interval.
