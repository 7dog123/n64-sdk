<a name="tip1"></a><h3>Bug: Back-to-Back Floating Point Multiplies May Give Incorrect Results (R4300 Bug)</h3>

Description:

<p>
The following back-to-back multiply code sequence in the processor pipeline 
has the potential of producing an incorrect result in the second 
multiply:

<p>
<pre>
    mul.[s,d] fd,fs,ft
    mul.[s,d] fd,fs,ft  or  [D]MULT[U] rs,rt
</pre>

<p>
The error happens only when the first multiply is single- or double-precision 
floating-point operation and when one or both of its source operands are:

<blockquote>
Signalling Not-a-Number (sNaN), 0 (Zero), or infinity (Inf).
</blockquote>

The second multiply instruction may produce an incorrect result depending 
on the operands of the 1st multiply and the operands of the and multiply.  
The second multiply can be a multiply of any data type: floating-point or 
integer, single- or double-precision, signed or unsigned integer.

<p>
This code sequence can occur in the pipeline in two ways:

<ol>
<li>The multiplies are back-to-back in the source code.
<li>The first multiply is in a branch delay slot and the second multiply is 
the target instruction of the branch.
</ol>

Software Workaround:

<p>
When an instruction of any kind (e.g. NOP) is executed between the two 
multiply instructions, the problem will not occur.

<p>
Release 2.0C includes a patch (patchSG0001118) to the C compiler and 
Assembler which reorders multiply code to avoid this bug. You must use the 
compiler option described in the patch release notes, which are located 
in

<blockquote>
patch1118/relnotes/patchSG0001118/ch1.z</FONT>
</blockquote>

If you use a different compiler or code in assembly language, you need to 
work around the problem as noted above.

<p>
Release 2.0C also includes a "checker" program called by makerom to ensure 
that programs are compiled with the proper compiler options to avoid this bug.

<p>
Affected Versions:

<p>
This problem happens on versions 1.x, 2.0 and 2.1 of the CPU.

<a name="tip2"></a><h3>Bug: RCP Audio Interface Occasionally DMAs From Bad Address</h3>

As mentioned in the 2.0C release notes, a bug in the RCP has been discovered 
that causes audio data to be DMAed from the incorrect memory location under 
certain circumstances.  It manifests itself in the application code as 
follows:

<p>
For consecutive calls to osAiSetNextBuffer(void *vaddr, u32 nbytes)

<ul>
<li>let vaddr1 be the vaddr parameter for the first call
<li>let nbytes1 be the nbytes parameter for the first call
<li>let vaddr2 be the vaddr parameter for the second call
<li>let X be the memory address where the audio data for the second call 
is actually read.
</ul>

<pre>
if ( ( (vaddr1 + nbytes1) &amp; 0x00003fff ) == 0x00002000 ) {
    X = vaddr2 + 0x00002000; // incorrect address
} else {
    X = vaddr2;              // correct address
}
</pre>

<p>
Depending on the data at vaddr2 + 0x2000, this may cause clicking in 
the audio.

<p>
To assure that the correct address is always read, you can either make 
sure that ((vaddr + nbytes) &amp; 0x00003fff) != 0x00002000 by moving the 
buffers, or you can also simply subtract 0x2000 from vaddr2 when vaddr1 + 
nbytes1 evaluates to the error condition. The second solution will be 
implemented in the next release (2.0D).

<a name="tip3"></a><h3>Bug: Sprintf Not Included In libultra_rom Library</h3>

The libultra version intended for building final roms, libultra_rom.a, 
does not include the sprintf() fuction. This will be fixed in the next 
release.  In the meantime, if you need the final rom version of libultra to 
burn roms for the launch, contact Developer Support at support@noa.com.

<a name="tip4"></a><h3>Tip: Setting Fog Values</h3>

The documentation concerning fog (specifically the gsSPFogPosition macros) 
is inaccurate.  The <a target=top href="../n64man/gsp/gSPFogPosition.html">gsSPFogPosition()</a> macro takes 2 parameters: min and max.  
The min parameter specifies where the fog will begin and max specifies where 
the fog will become fully saturated.  Both the min and max parameters range 
from 0 (indicating "AT THE NEAR PLANE") to 1000 (indicating "AT THE FAR 
PLANE").

<p>
Generally the mac parameter will always be set to 1000 so that objects AT 
the far plane (which are about to dissappear from view, or which have just 
popped into view) are completely fogged out (using such a setting will keep 
objects from visually "popping" on and off near the far clipping plane).  
The min parameter can be set anywhere from 0 to almost 1000.  The problem 
with the documentation is that it indicates that the number is linear with 
the Z position where the fog will begin in Z.  Actually this number is 
linear with the SCREENSPACE Z but not with the object space Z.  The 
screenspace Z is an inverse function of the object space Z (Zscreen = 
k/Zobject) and is "bunched up" at the far plane.  Therefore a min value of 
500 will actually begin the fog very close to the near plane.  A min value 
of 700 or more will push fog farther from the near plane so it does not 
obscure so much geometry.  The solution is to just use bigger numbers for 
min.  I find that values of 950 or higher sometimes give me the effect I 
want.

<a name="tip5"></a><h3>Tip: Disassembling Code With "<a target=top href="../n64man/tools/gdis.html">gdis</a>"</h3>

The new "gdis" disassembler is a powerful debugging aide that can help you 
turn a cryptic crash dump (i.e the text that is printed in your <a target=top href="../n64man/tools/gload.html">gload</a> window 
when your program takes an exception) into useful debugging information.

<p>
For example, you can disassemble the section named "code" (as specified in 
the spec file) in the "chrome" example application executable as follows:

<p>
<pre>
% <a target=top href="../n64man/tools/gdis.html">gdis</a> -S -t .code.text letters
</pre>

<p>
Here is a portion of the output ...

<p>
Notice that the C source is interleaved with the disassembled code, and 
that the PC is given in the second column.

<p>
When your program crashes, you can look up the error PC listed in the crash 
dump (it is identified as "epc") to determine where the program crashed and 
find the corresponding line in the source/disassembly listing.

<p>
Note: The usage of "gdis" is different from the older "newdis".

<a name="tip6"></a><h3>Tip: Handling Console RESET</h3>

When the console RESET switch is pushed, the hardware generates a HW2 
interrupt to the R4300 CPU. The interrupt is serviced by the OS event handler 
which sends a message of type OS_EVENT_PRENMI to the message queue associated 
with that event.

<p>
The HW2 interrupt will be followed in 0.5 seconds by a non-maskable 
interrupt (NMI) to the R4300 CPU (unless the RESET switch is pushed and 
held for more than 0.5 seconds, in which case the NMI will occur when the 
switch is released).

<p>
After the NMI occurs, the hardware is reinitialized, and

<ul>
<li>the first Meg of the game in ROM is copied into the first megabyte of 
RAM after the boot address
<li>the BSS for the boot segment is cleared
<li>the boot procedure is called
</ul>

Note: There are some minor differences between power on reset and NMI reset. 
After power on reset, the caches are invalidated.  After NMI reset, the 
caches are flushed and then invalidated. Also, the power on reset configures 
the RAM, while NMI reset leaves the RAMs alone.  After NMI reset, the 
contents of memory, except for the 1 Meg that is copied in, are the same as 
before the NMI occured. The global variable, osResetType, is set to 0 on 
a power up reset and to 1 on a NMI.

<p>
If your game does not use the scheduler, it should set up to respond to the 
OS_EVENT_PRENMI event by associating a message queue with the event early 
in the game code. This is accomplished as follows:

<p>
<pre>
<a target=top href="../n64man/os/osSetEventMesg.html">osSetEventMesg</a>(OS_EVENT_PRENMI, &lt;some_message_queue>)
</pre>

<p>
If your game does use the scheduler, it needs only to test for a message of 
type PRE_NMI_MSG on its client message queue. The scheduler performs the 
event initialization, and forwards the OS_EVENT_PRENMI message to the client 
message queue as soon as it is received.

<p>
When the game receives the OS_EVENT_PRENMI message it should do the 
following:

<ul>
<li>Stop issuing GFX tasks to prevent the RDP from potentially hanging
<li>Stop issuing audio tasks to prevent audio "pops"
<li>Stop issuing ROM (PI) DMAs
</ul>

To test this, you can generate an NMI on development board by running 
the following program ON THE INDY. This is equivalent to pushing the RESET 
switch on the Ultra 64 machine.

<p>
