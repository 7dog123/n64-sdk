<h2>Multi-National Compatibility of Controller Pak Data</h2>
<p>
Multi-national data exchange is on the horizon. Given one and the same game, 
the Read and Write functions must be standardized for Japan, the U.S., and 
Europe.  To maintain multi-national Controller Pak data compatibility, 
consider the following points.

<ol>
<li>Create a uniform Controller Pak game code for all countries.  This can be 
based upon the Game Pak game code assigned by Nintendo.
<li>Only English and the symbols 0Fh~41h can be used for note names. Do not 
use Katakana.
<li>Use the English version libnos.a for the Controller Pak menu utility 
when creating games for release outside the Japanese market. Use libnos_jpn.a 
for Japanese versions, but observe note 2., above.
</ol>

For data in the U.S. whose game files include katakana for note names, if 
data compatibility is preserved, the Katakana will be displayed as "-" 
without character corruption.
<p>
If LIBNOS.A is not being used to display Controller Pak fonts, the developer 
will have to work through a case where Katakana characters are stored in a 
Controller Pak.  When encountering illegal mode values, NOA recommends 
displaying "-" or "*", but " " (space) is also acceptable.
<p>
Our goal is to guarantee data compatibility for all versions of the same game.
