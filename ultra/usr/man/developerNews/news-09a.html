<h2>osPfsInitPak() Function Specification changes</h2>
<h3>1. Patch_4 (and earlier) Issues</h3>

With the previous  (Patch_4 / 8/28/98) osPfsInitPak() function and 
osPfsRepairId() function, a PFS_ERR_ID_FATAL error would be returned when:

<ul>
<li>a RumblePak or other peripheral device was inserted into the Controller, or
<li>when the contents of the ID area of the Controller Pak were overwritten.
</ul>

Because the error value was returned under various conditions, it was 
difficult to determine the real cause of the error, making the programming 
procedure extremely complicated.  This also led to a confusing series of 
messages being displayed to the game player.

<h3>2.  Patch_5 Corrections</h3>

With Patch_5, the osPfsInitPak() function and the osPfsRepairId() function 
now returns a PFS_ERR_DEVICE error rather than a PFS_ERR_ID_FATAL error, 
when a peripheral device other than the Controller Pak (i.e., Rumble Pak or 
64 Game Boy Pak) is inserted.

<p>
Internally, a read/write test is performed using a safe area in  the 
Controller Pak RAM .  If there is a failure during the read/write test, 
then it is assumed that there is no RAM and a PFS_ERR_DEVICE error is returned.

<h3>3.  Procedure for Identifying Multiple Types of Peripheral Devices</h3>

With the above noted changes, the procedure for identifying a specific 
peripheral device when multiple devices are used, (for example, when an 
application uses a Controller Pak and a Rumble Pak) is as follows.

<p>
<pre>
                osMotorInit()
                        |
                        |
        +-----------+
        | ret=0 | ret=PFS_ERR_DEVICE
        |               |
        (               (
  RumblePak   osPfsInitPak()
                        |
                        |
        +-----------+-----------------------+
        | ret=0 | ret=PFS_ERR_DEVICE    | ret=PFS_ERR_ID_FATAL
        |               |                               |
        (               (                               (
  Controller  Other Device              Since ID area has been destroyed,
     Pak         (64GB Pak, etc.)               after user confirmation, repair
                                                with osPfsRepairId()
</pre>

<h3>4.  Precautions</h3>

When using multiple peripheral devices, please be sure to  call the 
osPfsRepairId() function immediately after executing osPfsInitPak().  
Please note that even if osPfsInitPak() was called initially, the ID cannot 
be repaired once the initialization function for another peripheral device, 
such as the osMotorInit() function, has been called.

<p>
This is true not only for the osPfsRepairId() function, but for other pfs 
functions as well.  A PFS_ERR_INVALID error will be generated when this 
kind of call is performed.  This happens because the contents of the osPfs 
structure is overwritten with Rumble Pak information when osMotorInit()is 
called.  To avoid this error, call the osPfsInitPak() function again if a pfs 
function is to be called after osMotorInit has been called.

<p>
Note: Initialization can be completed without initializing each device 
separately by having an osPfs structure for each type of device and using 
one for each of the various device functions. However, this method should not 
be used because there may be situations in which unexpected operations are 
performed.  <u>Please be sure to call the corresponding initialization 
function each time a device is changed.</u>
