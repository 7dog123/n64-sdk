<A NAME="tip1"></A><h3>Tip: 16b RGBA Textures with more than 1-Bit Alphas</h3>

The 16 bit RGBA texture type is often used to texture sprites and billboards 
because this is the only type that allows a large number of colors.  
Unfortunately, this type only has one bit of alpha (which means you can't 
prefilter texture edges), and can lead to pixelated texture edges.

<p>
One way to get more bits of alpha (in order to create smoother outlines) is 
to use two tiles.  The first tile describes the RGB color of the 
texture, while the second tile describes the alpha channel of the 
texture.  Render the texture in two-cycle mode. In the color combiner, 
select T0 as the source and in the alpha combiner select T1 as the source.

<p>
A code fragment indicates how to set the combine modes and load the textures:

<p>
<pre>
    #define MULTIBIT_ALPHA&nbsp; 0, 0, 0, TEXEL0, 0, 0, 0, TEXEL1

    ...

      /* use special combine mode */
      <a target=top href="../n64man/gdp/gDPSetCombineMode.html">gsDPSetCombineMode</a>(MULTIBIT_ALPHA, G_CC_PASS2);

    ...

      /*
       * Load alpha texture at Tmem = 256, notice I use a different load
       * macro that allows specifying Tmem address.
       */
      _gsDPLoadTextureBlock_4b(I4molecule, 256, G_IM_FMT_I,
                32, 32, 0,
                G_TX_WRAP, G_TX_WRAP,
                5, 5, G_TX_NOLOD, G_TX_NOLOD);

      /* 
       * Load color texture starting at Tmem=0
       */

      <a target=top href="../n64man/gdp/gDPLoadTextureBlock.html">gsDPLoadTextureBlock</a>(RGBA16molecule, G_IM_FMT_RGBA, G_IM_SIZ_16b,
                32, 32, 0,
                G_TX_WRAP, G_TX_WRAP,
                5, 5, G_TX_NOLOD, G_TX_NOLOD);

      /*
       * Since normal load macros use tile 0 for render, I need to set
       * tile 1 manually to point at alpha texture.
       */
      <a target=top href="../n64man/gdp/gDPSetTile.html">gsDPSetTile</a>(G_IM_FMT_I, G_IM_SIZ_4b, 2, 256, 1, 
                0,
                0, 0, 0,
                0, 0, 0);
      <a target=top href="../n64man/gdp/gDPSetTileSize.html">gsDPSetTileSize</a>( 1, 0, 0, 31 << 2, 31 << 2);

    ...
 
      /* Make sure in two-cycle mode */
      <a target=top href="../n64man/gdp/gDPSetCycleType.html">gsDPSetCycleType</a>(G_CYC_2CYCLE);

<A NAME="tip2"></A><h3>Tip: Rendering Clouds or Explosions</h3>

Implement rendering effects such as smoke clouds or explosions with a 
texture. Set the texture alpha to the outline of the smoke or explosion
and render the texture onto a transparent polygon so that one can see 
through the smoke to the objects behind.

<p>
In this situation, the correct <a target=top href="../n64man/gdp/gDPSetRenderMode.html">g*DPSetRenderMode()</a> to use is:

<blockquote>
RM_ZB_CLD_SURF or RM_CLD_SURF
</blockquote>

This 'cloud' mode preserves the antialiasing of objects behind the cloud 
primitive, unlike TEX_EDGE and XLU_SURF modes.

<A NAME="tip3"></A><h3>Tip: Improving Z Buffer Performance</h3>

A &quot;partial sorting&quot; of objects being drawn can accelerate rendering 
when using z-buffering. The z-buffer test is a conditional write, so if 
objects are drawn in roughly front-to-back order, this test will often 
prevent the write to update the z-buffer value.

<A NAME="tip4"></A><h3>Tip: Man Pages</h3>

The default release install the man pages in /usr/share/catman. If 
you install it elsewhere, be sure to run 'makewhatis' and update the
whatis database, so you can use the powerful 'man -k' and 'apropos' 
commands.

<p>
Likewise, if you installed the man pages in the default location, but 
you've never heard of 'man -k', check it out.

<A NAME="tip5"></A><h3>Tip: Using the Turbo Microcode</h3>

Using the new 'turbo' microcode requires some sorting on the CPU. The 
turbo ucode is extremely efficient if you can use a 'bounding box' or 
'object centroid' sort technique. This technique can require careful 
modeling, and for some scenarios it's downright difficult.

<p>
Note: We are also considering other types of sorting, such as an individual 
polygon sort. Desigining such a sort that works well on the Ultra64, given 
the graphics pipeline depth, vector RSP, etc., is not simple. If anybody 
has any suggestions or ideas they want to share, email Developer Support
at support@noa.com.

<A NAME="tip6"></A><h3>Tip: Gamma Correction</h3>

SNES and Super Famicom do not have gamma correction hardware but the Nintendo 
64 does. Some developers have indicated that the colors look washed out on 
the Ultra 64 with gamma correction turned on.

<p>
If you are currently writing games for SNES or Super Famicom (or any machine 
that does not have gamma correction), your production path is likely to be 
setup to compensate for the lack of gamma correction hardware. In other
words, you are probably picking pre-gamma corrected colors. If you use this 
same production path and turn Ultra 64 gamma correction on, you will get the 
wash out effect because you would have gamma corrected twice.

<p>
To undo the first gamma correction, square and shift down by 8 each color 
component (assuming 8 bit color) or rework your path to exclude the gamma
correction stop, leaving gamma correction to the hardware.

<A NAME="tip7"></A><h3>New: Blender Add Mode</h3>

A new <a target=top href="../n64man/gdp/gDPSetRenderMode.html">g*DPSetRenderMode()</a> has been implemented that allows the pixel color 
to be added to the memory color.&nbsp; The macro has been added to gbi.h
and will be available on the next release. In the interim, you can define 
the following:

<p>
<pre>
    #define RM_ADD(clk) \
        IM_RD | CVG_DST_SAVE | FORCE_BL | ZMODE_OPA \
        GBL_c##clk(G_BL_CLR_IN, G_BL_A_FOG, G_BL_CLR_MEM, G_BL_1)

    #define G_RM_ADD       RM_ADD(1)
    #define G_RM_ADD2      RM_ADD(2)
</pre>

<p>
Several notes about this mode:

<ul>
<li>You must set fog alpha equal to 0xff for this mode to work, e.g. 
<a target=top href="../n64man/gdp/gDPSetFogColor.html">gsDPSetFogColor</a>(255, 255, 255, 255).
<li>Since the blender does not clamp the final color (all the inputs are 
clamped and normal interpolation operations won't under/overflow) the user 
must guarantee that the results will not overflow or weird effects may occur.
</ul>

<A NAME="tip8"></A><h3>Note: System Software Release with Ultra64 Development Software</h3>

Ultra64 development software works with System Software Relase 5.3 only. 
We anticipate supporting 6.2 when it is released, but no date has been
set.

<A NAME="tip9"></A><h3>Bug: Audio DMA Example Code</h3>

There are two bugs in the audio dma initialization example code. Neither 
effect the operation of the examples, but if you have incorporated this code
into your game you may want to change fix it as described below.

<p>
The first bug occurs in the code that allocates buffers to handle audio dma 
requests. In in the routine __amDmaNew (in simple/audio.c), the following
code allocates the buffers:

<p>
<pre>
    for (i=0; i&lt;NUM_DMA_BUFFERS-1; i++)
    {
      alLink((ALLink*)&amp;dmaBuffs[i+1],(ALLink*)&amp;dmaBuffs[i]);
      dmaBuffs[i].ptr = <a target=top href="../n64man/al/alHeapAlloc.html">alHeapAlloc</a>(&amp;hp, 1, DMA_BUFFER_LENGTH);
    }
</pre>

<p>
Notice that the for loop iterates to NUM_DMA_BUFFERS-1, not NUM_DMA_BUFFERS 
(needed since the last dma buffer can't be linked to a dmaBuffs[i+1] which 
doesn't exist) so the last buffer is never allocated.

<p>
The second bug (in the same code) occurs when you move the location of the 
dmaBuffs to uninitialized memory (non-global memory) or reinitialize the
dmaBuffs. In that case, the values of the first dmaBuff's node.prev and 
node.next are uninitialized.

<p>
Both of these bugs can be avoided by changing the portion of the 
__amDmaNew routine shown above to:

<p>
<pre>
    dmaBuffs[0].node.prev = 0;
    dmaBuffs[0].node.next = 0;
    for (i=0; i&lt;NUM_DMA_BUFFERS-1; i++)
    {
      alLink((ALLink*)&amp;dmaBuffs[i+1],(ALLink*)&amp;dmaBuffs[i]);
      dmaBuffs[i].ptr = <a target=top href="../n64man/al/alHeapAlloc.html">alHeapAlloc</a>(&amp;hp, 1, DMA_BUFFER_LENGTH);
    }

    /* last buffer already linked, but still needs buffer */
    dmaBuffs[i].ptr = <a target=top href="../n64man/al/alHeapAlloc.html">alHeapAlloc</a>(&amp;hp,1,DMA_BUFFER_LENGTH);
</pre>

<A NAME="tip10"></A><h3>Bug: midiDmon</h3>

A bug that prevented midiDmon from running in the last release (1.0F/2.0B) 
has been corrected. New versions of midiDmon are available via ftp from 
sgi.com.

<ul>
<li>ftp to sgi.com
<li>log in as name: &quot;anonymous&quot; passwd: &lt;your email 
address&gt;
<li>cd to private
<li>get midiDmon.hw1 for hardware 1 dev systems, or midiDmon.hw2 for 
hardware 2 dev systems.
</ul>
