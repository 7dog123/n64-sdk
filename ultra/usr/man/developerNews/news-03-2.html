<h2>Control Stick RESET Function</h2>
<h3>Control Stick Program Cautions</h3>

The Control Stick has a RESET function (refer to "Control Stick Function")
that operates when the L and R Buttons and the START Button are pressed 
simultaneously. Because this is a hardware function, note the following 
programming cautions.

<OL>
<LI>When the L, R, and START Buttons are pressed simultaneously, the Control 
Stick's neutral position changes.
<LI>With these buttons pressed simultaneously, the application software can 
be verified by checking for the JSRST flag.
</OL>

The application software detects those buttons that are frequently pressed 
simultaneously and activates special modes. Since the simultaneous pressing 
of the L, R, and START Buttons activates the RESET function, it is preferable 
not to use this combination in games which use the Control Stick.
<p>
The simultaneous pressing of the L, R, and START buttons cannot normally be 
detected. Whenever it is detected, check for the JSRST flag.

<h3>Control Stick Function</h3>

The Control Stick enables precision operation by reading the stick's physical 
angles and directions. This affords more precise character movement than a 
conventional controller button.
<p>
Please include instructions concerning the proper use of the Control Stick in 
each Game Pak Instruction Booklet. The following items are explained in the 
Control Deck Instruction Booklet.

<ol>
<li>When turning the Nintendo 64 Power Switch ON, do not touch the Control 
Stick.
<li>The position of the Control Stick when the Control Deck's Power Supply is 
turned ON is called the "Neutral position." If the Control Stick is slanted 
when power is applied, this slanted position become its Neutral position and 
the Control Stick may not operate correctly.
<li>Once the Control Stick is in the correct Neutral position (center stop), 
perform the following. Remove your fingers from the Control Stick, hold down 
the L and R Buttons, and the START Button (Control Stick RESET function).
<li>Placing liquids or foreign objects in the Control Stick may damage the 
Control Stick. Should an accident occur, consult your nearest Nintendo dealer 
or the place of purchase.
</ol>

<h3>Holding the Controller (Example)</h3>

Holding the Nintendo 64 Controller varies with each type of game. There are 
three basic ways to hold the Controller.

<ol>
<li>Right position
<br>
Used with games which primarily use the Control Stick, A Button, B Button, 
and C Button.

<li>Left position
<br>
Used with games which primarily use the Control Stick and Control Pad.

<li>Super NES Position
<br>
Used with games which primarily use the Control Pad, A Button, B Button, and C Button.
</ol>

Indicate the recommended method to be used for holding the Controller in each 
Game Pak Instruction Booklet.
