<h2>Overview of EEPROM (Electrical Erasable Programmable ROM)</h2>

EEPROM is built in a Game Pak and used to save data while the game is in 
progress. EEPROM is equipped with a circuit to communicate with a serial 
interface of a RCP.

<h3>Capacity of EEPROM</h3>

EEPROM has two types of capacity. One is 4k-EEPROM. Its capacity is 4k bit 
(64 words x 64 bit = 512 bytes). Another is 16k-EEPROM. Its capacity is 16k 
bit (256 words x 64 bit = 2048 bytes).

<p>
Previously, there was only 4k-EEPROM. So, EEPROM functions do not correspond 
to 16k-EEPROM for previous versions of NINTENDO OS 2.0H. When creating
an application which uses 16k-EEPROM for a previous OS of 2.0H, a patch for 
16k-EEPROM is necessary.

<h3>Reliability of Data</h3>

The current EEPROM is capable of rewriting 100,000 times.  It can rewrite 
about 100,000 times for each EEPROM address (0 - 63 for 4k-EEPROM, 0 - 255
for 16k-EEPROM) correctly, however, there is a possibility that it won't 
rewrite correctly beyond that due to deterioration of memory cells.

<p>
It is also possible to store data for ten years. If it won't write anew for 
more than 10 years, an electric charge of memory cells may become weak 
gradually and it may become impossible to read data correctly.

<p>
To avoid these problems, it is recommended to maintain the reliability of 
data using supplementary data such as a check sum or a parity bit

<h3>Precautions when Writing Data</h3>
When writing data (<a target=top href="../n64man/os/osEepromWrite.html">osEepromWrite</a>), there is a wait of approximately 15 msec 
between the interface circuit's reception of the write command and completion 
of data being written to the memory cells. If a second osEepromWrite is 
called during this period, the program will go into a needless "read status" 
polling loop inside the function until the first write command is completed.  
Therefore, when performing consecutive writes, more than 15 msec must be 
allowed between the completion of one write command and execution of the next 
write command.
<p>
The command <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osEepromLongWrite.html">osEepromLongWrite</a> uses the CPU timer to create the required 15 
msec interval. The timer is set to interrupt after 15 msec, while the thread 
that called the function goes to the wait status.

<h3>Explanations of EEPROM Functions</h3>

<font face="courier">s32 <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osEepromProbe.html">osEepromProbe</a>(OSMesgQueue *mq)</font>

<p>
This function will check if EEPROM is there. If it exists, this will check 
which type it is.

<p>
If a return value is 1 (defined by EEPROM_TYPE_4K), 4k-EEPROM is there. If a 
return value is 2 (defined by EEPROM_TYPE_16K), 16k-EEPROM is there. If a 
return value is 0, there is no EEPROM. Also, if there is a hardware-related
(communication path) error, 0 will be returned. If EEPROM_TYPE_16K is 
returned when 4k-EEPROM is equipped, or EEPROM_TYPE_4k is returned when 
16k-EEPROM is equipped, a wrong game pak may be used, or a game pak may be 
broken. The application program must be stopped.

<p>
<font face="courier">s32 <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osEepromWrite.html">osEepromWrite</a>(OSMesgQueue *mq, u8 address, u8 *buffer)</font>

<p>
This function will write an 8 byte data to an EEPROM address (if 4k-EEPROM, 
0 - 63, and if 16k-EEPROM, 0 - 255). If the write command is sent to an 
interface circuit correctly, 0 will be returned. If the address is not a 
value within a correct range, -1 will be returned. If EEPROM is not there 
(due to a communication path related problem), or an interface circuit does 
not respond, 8(CONT_NO_RESPONSE_ERROR) will be returned.

<p>
<font face="courier">s32 <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osEepromRead.html">osEepromRead</a>(OSMesgQueue *mq, u8 address, u8 *buffer)</font>

<p>
This function will read an 8 byte data from an EEPROM address (if 4k-EEPROM, 
0 - 63, and if 16k-EEPROM, 0 - 255). If the data is read correctly (if there 
is no communication path related error), 0 will be returned. If the address 
is not a value within a correct range, -1 will be returned. If EEPROM is not 
there or an interface circuit does not respond, 8 (CONT_NO_RESPONSE_ERROR) 
will be returned.

<p>
<font face="courier">s32 <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osEepromLongWrite.html">osEepromLongWrite</a>(OSMesgQueue *mq, u8 address, u8 *buffer, int length)</font>

<p>
This function will write data of continuous 8 x length bytes to an EEPROM 
address (if 4k-EEPROM, 0 - 63, and if 16k-EEPROM, 0 - 255). As a matter
of fact, it only calls osEepromWrite a length time within the function. 
However, it is designed to wait for 15 milli-seconds for each writing using 
a CPU timer. As for a return value, 0 will be returned when all the write 
commands (length times commands) are sent to an interface circuit correctly, 
just like with the case of osEepromWrite. If the address is not a value 
within a correct range, -1 will be returned. If EERPOM is not there or an 
interface circuit does not respond, 8(CONT_NO_RESPONSE_ERROR) will be 
returned.

<p>
<font face="courier">s32 <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osEepromLongRead.html">osEepromLongRead</a>(OSMesgQueue *mq, u8 address, u8 *buffer, int length)</font>

<p>
This function will read data of continuous 8 x length bytes from an EEPROM 
address (if 4k-EEPROM, 0 - 63, and if 16k-EEPROM, 0 - 255). In fact, in only 
calls osEepromRead a length time within the function. As for a return value, 
0 will be returned when all the commands (length times commands) are read 
correctly, just like with the case of osEepromRead. If the addess is not a 
value within a correct range, -1 will be returned. If EEPROM is not there or 
an interface circuit does not respond, 8(CONT_NO_RESPONSE_ERROR) will be 
returned.
