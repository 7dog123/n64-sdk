<h2>PAL Version Game and Development Environment</h2>

The N64 OS receives information from the PIF when the Control Deck is booted 
and determines whether the N64 Control Deck is NTSC or PAL.  The information 
is stored as osTvType.  According to this variable, the VI Manager sets the 
default screen mode and variable osViClock.

<p>
When calling <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osAiSetFrequency.html">osAiSetFrequency()</a> and setting the audio output frequency, the 
function sets the audio DAC rate according to osViClock.  In other words, if 
the osViClock variable has not been set using the following procedure, the 
audio output frequency will not be set correctly.  (We are going to upgrade 
the OS so that <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osCreateViManager.html">osCreateViManager()</a> and osAiSetFrequency() can be called in any order.)

Because the PIF that is mounted on the N64 Emulator Board only exists in the 
NTSC version, it is always set for NTSC.  This also applies to the Emulator 
Board that is modified for the PAL version (by replacing the crystal). Therefore, when a game is made for the PAL version, it works 
well in the N64 (PAL) Control Deck, but on the N64 (PAL) Emulator Board, the music is not as intended.   To avoid this problem, please set the variable 
osTvType to OS_TV_PAL, as follows.

<p>
<pre>
        osTvType = OS_TV_PAL;                   /* os.h.  */

        <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osInitialize.html">osInitialize()</a>;

        <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osCreateViManager.html">osCreateViManager</a>(priority);
                     .
                     .
        <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osAiSetFrequency.html">osAiSetFrequency</a>(frequency);
                     .
                     .
</pre>
<p>

Version 2.0E and older versions of the N64 OS have a system anomaly which 
forces the TV type to NTSC.  (On both the Emulator Board and the Control 
Deck.)   A software patch "Patch1118" was released by NOA to all developers 
with version 2.0E software, in order that they may work around this anomaly.  
Patch1118 must be used with all 2.0E and older version software.

<p>
Please use the following procedure when osAiSetFrequency() must be called 
before calling osCreateViManager().

<p>
<pre>
        extern int osViClock;

        osTvType = OS_TV_PAL;
        osViClock = VI_PAL_CLOCK;

        <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osInitialize.html">osInitialize()</a>;
                 .
                 .
        <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osAiSetFrequency.html">osAiSetFrequency</a>(frequency);
                 .
                 .
        <a target=top href="../n64man/os/osCreateViManager.html">osCreateViManager</a>(priority);
                 .
                 .
