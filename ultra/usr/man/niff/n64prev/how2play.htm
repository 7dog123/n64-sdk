<h3>Common Methods of Operation</h3>

<P>The N64 Controller can be used to manipulate and operate the n64prev Previewer.</P>

<ul>
      <li><B>Control Pad and Start Button:</B> Manipulate the Previewer menus
      <li><B>A Button:</B> Plays the animation
      <li><B>B Button:</B> Plays the animation in reverse
</ul>

<P>Two methods are used to operate the Previewer:</P>

<h4>1. Track Ball</h4>

<P>The displayed object is projected inside a virtual trackball so that by rotating the trackball the object can be rotated, enabling it to be viewed from any angle.</P>

<P>The Control Stick and Z Button are used to emulate the manipulation of a track ball. Pulling the Z Button is like touching the track ball. If the Control Stick is manipulated at the same time the Z Button is pulled, the model will rotate.</P>

<P>Holding down the Control Stick while letting go of the Z Button enables the model to continue to rotate.</P>

<P>Moving the Control Stick up or down while pushing the R Button increases or decreases the distance from the camera to the model.</P>

<P>The four C Buttons are used for X, Y parallel movement of the model. Please use caution due to the accelerated motion.</P>

<P>Use the four C Buttons while pushing the R Button to fine-tune the displayed position.</P>

<P>Pull down the Control Stick while pushing the L Button to adjust X, L scaling.</P>

<P>Pull down the Control Stick while pushing both the L and R Buttons to adjust Z scaling.</P>

<h4>2. Helicopter Cruise</h4>

<P>The camera can travel around the perimeter of the object and look around as if in a virtual helicopter.</P>

<P>The Control Stick works like a joystick to control direction. Tilt the stick horizontally to change direction in the XZ plane. This also has some effect on camera angle.</P>

<P>The amount of vertical tilt moves the camera direction in a range between the zenith and directly below.</P>

<P>Use the L and R Buttons to respectively move toward and retreat from the camera direction.</P>

<P>Use the Control Pad Up and Down Buttons to respectively shift gears up and down. There are a total of six speeds, and movement begins in third speed.</P>

<P>Use the C Buttons for vertical climb/descent relative to camera direction, or for left/right parallel movement.</P>

<P>You can switch between these two methods of operation by using the Previewer menus.</P>
</ul>
