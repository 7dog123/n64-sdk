<h2>1. NIFF 2.0 Environment</h2>

<blockquote>In addition to the previous NIFF environment, the new release
of NIFF 2.0 environment is designed for taking full advantage of the NVF
library, its application tool 'nvfview' pre- viewer and the NIFF to NVF
converter 'niff2nvf'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Also, the NIFF API support library and its basic application
libraries, called NIFF Tools, enable users to customize NIFF 2.0.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Off course, it is possible that previous NIFF 1.0 files can be used by the tools described above. In actual game development, these tools
would be essential.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Updated 'niff2gfx' and 'n64prev' are included for the user
who already uses niff2gfx + nd.
<br></blockquote>

<blockquote>The following list describes the contents of this release.</blockquote>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>NIFFeditor&nbsp;</td>

<td>This tool is used to edit the hierarchical structure of NIFF and flag data. Conversion and editing of data with IS-Viewer 64 is possible by using niff2gfx, n64prev, niff2nvf and nvfview. SGI and Win95/NT versions of NIFFeditor are available.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>niff2gfx&nbsp;</td>

<td>This tool converts NIFF to N64. It outputs the structure data of a
scene, object and animation that are used by the drawing object manager
called 'nd', and also, outputs the display list which is in accordance
with N64GBI.&nbsp; SGI and Win95/NT versions are available.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>NVF&nbsp;</td>

<td>Data format which displays the features of NIFF on an actual N64. 
The format can be used directly by N64.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>niff2nvf&nbsp;</td>

<td>This tool converts NIFF to NVF. It converts NIFF 2.0 data to
the NVF node. Also, it is compatible with NIFF 1.0.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>nvfview&nbsp;</td>

<td>An N64 pre-viewer that utilizes NVF. It consists of libraries which display
NVF.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>NIFFAPI&nbsp;</td>

<td>Supports libraries which enable users to customize a NIFF file. The basic
API (like NIFF file Open) is available.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>NIFF Tools&nbsp;</td>

<td>These tools enable users to edit NIFF files. The basic tools (such as the binary to text converter) are available.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>n64prev&nbsp;</td>

<td>Directory which contains the source code of 'nd' (which also supports
NIFF1.0) and the pre-viewer software, (for convenience, refer to 'n64prev'
as the 'pre-viewer'). After reading 'niff2gfx' converted data, a ROM file
can be created by 'make' the data. The ROM file enables it to be 'pre-viewed'
using an actual Nintendo 64. However, NIFF 2.0 expanded data is not supported.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>MultiTextureViewer&nbsp;</td>

<td>This tool is not related directly to NIFF. This is a tool for confirming
the texture data in BMP and RGB format using an actual N64. 'N64CITextureEditor'
format can be pre-viewed. Also, it enables the user to output the format of N64
to a text format.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CITextureEditor&nbsp;</td>

<td>This editor creates the CI (color index) texture. The tool consists
of the pre-view function, the palette editor, etc. These functions
are necessary to create CI texture.</td>
</tr>

<li>
Animation Constraint function</li>

<li>
Functions with Hermite Interpolation</li>

<li>
Double Joints Inverse Kinematics function</li>

<li>
Flexible Envelope function</li>

<li>
Fog scene data is added</li>
</ul>
The new addition of the NVF format also functions with the new features
above, and is supported by the display libraries. 'nvfview'
is structured by these libraries.
