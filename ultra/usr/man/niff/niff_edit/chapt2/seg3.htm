<h3>
<font color="#0000A0"><font size=+0>Select link</font></font></h3>
<font color="#000000">When you click on a link with the left mouse button,
the link will turn red indicating that it has been selected. You can then
delete the selected link by choosing Delete Link from the Edit menu.</font>
<h3>
<font color="#0000A0"><font size=+0>Display node dialog box</font></font></h3>
<font color="#000000">When you double-click the left mouse button on a
node, the dialog box corresponding to that node will be displayed. You
can edit the name or flags of that node in this dialog box. It is possible
to display a dialog box for all of the currently displayed nodes.</font>
<h3>
<font color="#0000A0"><font size=+0>Select area</font></font></h3>
<font color="#000000">When you drag the mouse while pressing the left mouse
button, a rectangle will be displayed, which enables you to select the
entire area surrounded by the rectangle. The selected nodes can be collectively
moved, or commands can be simultaneously executed for them from a pop-up
menu.</font>
<h3>
<font color="#0000A0"><font size=+0>Select all nodes from that point down</font></font></h3>
<font color="#000000">When you click the left mouse button on a node while
holding down the <b>Shift</b> key, all nodes subsequent to that node (inclusive)
can be selected. The selected nodes can be collectively moved, or commands
can be simultaneously executed for them from a pop-up menu.</font>
<h3>
<font color="#0000A0"><font size=+0>Select additional links, nodes</font></font></h3>
<font color="#000000">When you click the left mouse button on a node while
holding down the <b>Ctrl</b> key, you can select nodes in addition to the
one currently selected. The selected nodes can be collectively moved, or
commands can be simultaneously executed for them from a pop-up menu.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">When you click the left mouse button on a link
while holding down the Ctrl key, you can select links in addition to the
one currently selected. However, even if multiple links are selected, no
more than one link can be manipulated at a time.</font>

<blockquote>
<h3>
<font color="#0000A0"><font size=+0>Move link (paste)</font></font></h3>
<font color="#000000">You can paste a link by dragging the link with the
center mouse button. The mouse pointer will become a (P) or a (C) depending
on the location at which the center button was pressed. For links, when
the pointer is a (P), the parent node is changed; if it is a (C), the child
node is changed. (The link arrow indicates parent -> child.)</font>
<p><font color="#000000">If a link is moved while pressing the center button
(dragged), and then the center button is released on the node where you
want to paste, that node will become a parent/child according to the (P)/(C)
display. In the current version, this applies to the pasting of only some
of the links (see the <a href="../NIFFed/NIFFedChap2-8.html">Limitations</a>
section). A warning will appear if you attempt to move a link that cannot
be pasted.</font>
<h3>
<font color="#0000A0"><font size=+0>Move node</font></font></h3>
<font color="#000000">Nodes can be moved by dragging them with the middle
mouse button. If multiple nodes are selected, those nodes can be moved
simultaneously.</font>
<h3>
<font color="#0000A0"><font size=+0>Create new link</font></font></h3>
<font color="#000000">A new link can be created by dragging with the middle
mouse button depressed while holding down the <b>Shift</b> key.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">To create a link, click the middle button on the
node that you want to be the parent while holding down the <b>Shift</b>
key. Then while still holding down the buttons, drag to the node that you
want to be the child and release the buttons.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Links cannot be created where there is a restriction
in the NIFF specification. In addition, a duplicate link cannot be created
where a link already exists.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Links can be created between scene-obj, obj-obj,
obj-shape, obj-mat, obj-anim, shape-mat, part-mat, and mat-texture.</font>
<h3>
<font color="#0000A0"><font size=+0>Move window</font></font></h3>
<font color="#000000">When the size of the window displaying node attributes
exceeds screen size, the window can be moved by dragging it with the middle
mouse button on the frame of the window.</font>
