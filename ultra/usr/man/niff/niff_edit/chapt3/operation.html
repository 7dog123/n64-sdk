<p>Here we explain the procedures for operating NIFF Editor.</p>

<h3><a name="read">Reading NIFF files</a></h3>

<p>There are two ways to read a NIFF file with NIFF Editor:</p>

<ul>
<li>Select Open from the File menu to display the File dialog window, then either select or enter the name of the file you want to read.
<li>A NIFF file can be easily opened by dragging and dropping the icon for the NIFF file onto an already-open NIFF Editor or onto the NIFF Editor icon (or icon shortcut) on the desktop or in Explorer. <br>
However, please note that if you drag & drop a NIFF file onto a NIFF Editor that is already reading some other NIFF file, then that other NIFF file will be discarded.
</ul>

<p>The current version of NIFF Editor can read NIFF specification version 1.0 NIFF files.</p>

<h3><a name="link">Manipulating Links</a></h3>

<p>Use the following Drag & Drop procedure to easily paste links between nodes with NIFF Editor.</p>

<ul>
<li>Move the mouse pointer to the node you want to paste and press the left mouse button.
<li>Drag the pointer to the node you want to link while keeping the left button depressed. 
<li>Release the left mouse button above the node you want to link to move the link; press the Ctrl key before releasing the left button to copy the link.
</ul>

<h3><a name="node">Manipulating nodes</a></h3>

<p>Use the various commands from the Edit menu or from the pop-up menu to Cut, Copy, Paste and Delete nodes.</p>

<ul>
<li>To Cut a node, select the node and then select the Cut command.  The cut node is copied to the clipboard, so it can be pasted at a later time.
<li>To Copy a node to the clipboard, select the node and then select the Copy command.
<li>To Paste a node that has been copied to the clipboard with either the Cut or Copy command, select the node and then select the Paste command.
<li>To remove a node from a NIFF file, use the Delete command.  When this command is used, the node's links are deleted, and then if other nodes do not link to it, the node itself is deleted.  After that, the node's child nodes are also deleted, providing no nodes other than the parent node link to them.
</ul>

<h3><a name="flag">Manipulating flags</a></h3>

<p>Select the Properties command from the File menu to view the node name and flag information of the currently selected node.  The same information can be viewed by moving the mouse above a desired node, clicking the right button to display a pop-up menu, and then selecting the Properties command.  By displaying the properties in this way you can manipulate the flags for each node.</p>

<p>The dislpayed properties will differ, depending on the node selected.  Use the index below to view the Properties Summary and details about the properties of each node.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="property.htm">Properties Summary</a>
<li><a href="scenepro.htm">Scene node properties</a>
<li><a href="envpro.htm">Environment node properties</a>
<li><a href="campro.htm">Camera node properties</a>
<li><a href="lightpro.htm">Light node properties</a>
<li><a href="objpro.htm">Object node properties</a>
<li><a href="shapepro.htm">Shape node properties</a>
<li><a href="tripro.htm">Triangle node properties</a>
<li><a href="partpro.htm">Part node properties</a>
<li><a href="matpro.htm">Material node properties</a>
<li><a href="texpro.htm">Texture node properties</a>
<li><a href="animpro.htm">Animation node properties</a>
</ul>

<h3><a name="convert">Convert</a></h3>

<p>Select the Convert command from the Tools menu after pasting node links and changing flags in order to convert the results into a display list.  When this menu item is selected, the NIFFCONV.BAT batch file is activated and the data is converted.  It is first necessary to setup Convert and set the Convert settings with the Options command in the Tools menu. </p>

<h3><a name="preview">Preview</a></h3>

<p>Select the Preview command from the Tools menu after pasting node links and changing flags in order to preview the results.  When this menu item is selected, the currently set NIFF file is output, converted, and after make and makemask are performed the created file is sent to IS-VIEWER64 so the results can be checked on NINTENDO<sup>64</sup>.  It is first necessary to setup Preview and set the Preview settings with the Options command in the Tools menu.</p>

<h3><a name="quickpreview">Quick Preview</a></h3>

<p>To take a quick preview of the NIFF file, select the Quick Preview command from the Tools menu, or click the Quick Preview button on the Tool Bar.  With the Preview command, the NIFF file is converted and then compiled with exeGCC to create a file which is then loaded into IS-VIEWER64 for viewing.  But with the Quick Preview command, compiling with exeGCC is unnecessary, so the results can be previewed more quickly.  It is first necessary to setup Quick Preview and set the Quick Preview settings with the Options command in the Tools menu. </p>

<h3><a name="save">Saving NIFF files</a></h3>

<p>Select Save from the File menu and the contents loaded into NIFF Editor will overwrite and be saved to the file with the same file name.  Select Save As from the File menu and the File dialog window will open, allowing you to select a name or enter a name for the file where the contents will be saved.  At this time, if a file with the same name already exists, a dialog  will ask whether it is OK to replace the existing file.</p>
