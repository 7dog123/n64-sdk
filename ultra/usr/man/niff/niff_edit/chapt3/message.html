<p>NIFF Editor generates two kinds of messages: <a href="#warning">Warning messages</a> and <a href="#error">Error messages</a>.</p>
<p>Warning messages offer the user the chance to either proceed or terminate some process.  When a warning is generated during the execution of NIFF Editor, a message box like the one below is displayed on the screen.  Click Yes to execute the task explained in the message and continue  processing, or click No to terminate without executing the task.</p>

<div align="center">

<p>An error message is generated when execution of a process cannot proceed.  The cause of the error must be found and resolved.  Refer to the explanations below for the reasons for each error message that is displayed, and take the appropriate actions to resolve the problem.</p>

<h3><a name="warning">Warning messages</a></h3>

<p>Here we explain the warning messages output by NIFF Editor.</p>
<dl>
<!--
<dt><font color="brown"><strong>Wrong Name area size.  Recalculate?</strong></font>
<dd><p>This message is generated when the size stored in the Name area's "name size" differs from the value calculated from the NIFF file data.  If you click "Yes" the correct Name area size will be calculated from the NIFF file data and placed in "name size" so the system can continue to read the NIFF file.  If you click "No" the read process will be terminated.<br>
Since this warning message is generated when the Name area data in the NIFF file you want to open is wrong, the only way to really solve the problem is to make corrections to the application that output the NIFF file.</p>
-->

</font><dt><font color="maroon"><strong>Cannot find linked node.  Continue reading?</strong></font>
<dd><p>The node in question was not found in the link index.  NIFF Editor asks whether to change that index value to the unlinked state and continue reading.  Click Yes to unlink and continue reading, or click No to terminate the read.</p>
</dl>

<h3><a name="error">Error messages</a></h3>

<p>Here we explain the error messages output by NIFF Editor.</p>

The name of the node where the error occurred is substituted for ???</p>

<dt><font color="red"><strong>Wrong size in area ???</strong></font>
<dd><p>When NIFF Editor reads a NIFF file it checks the size of every node.  This error is generated when a size is different from the expected size.  Check to see whether the NIFF file is corrupted.<br>
The name of the node where the error occurred is substituted for ???</p>

The Help file should be in the help sub-directory below the directory where NIFF Editor is stored.  An error is generated if this Help file cannot be found.  The file might have been accidently deleted, or there may have been some failure during NIFF Editor setup.  Please perform the NIFF Editor <a href="setup.html">Setup</a> procedure again.<br>
Also, because the Help file is in HTML format, it must be viewed using a browser.  Thus, this error message can also arise if a browser has not been installed or if the browser cannot handle the HTML files.  The following browsers are recommended for use with NIFF Editor: Microsoft Corporation's Internet Explorer version 3.0 or later, Netscape Communications Corporation's Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Netscape Communicator 4.0 or later.</p>
