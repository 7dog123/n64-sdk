<p>NIFF Editor is a tool for editing the link information and flag information contained in the NIFF files output by commercial graphics tools that support the Nintendo Intermediate File Format (NIFF).</p>

<p>As the name implies, a NIFF file is an intermediate format file which contains all of the scene data made with the graphics tool.  Though the data is in binary format, it is not advisable to directly create or edit the information in the NIFF file with a binary editor.  The NIFF Editor provides an easy way to edit these NIFF files.  For example, changing node link information becomes a simple Drag & Drop procedure using NIFF Editor, and flag information can be edited in the various node properties.</p>

<p>Morever, if you have the IS-VIEWER64, then you can preview the NIFF file on  NINTENDO<sup>64</sup> during editing. Two functions are provided: one that converts the NIFF file so that the file can be compiled using exeGCC and then read by IS-VIEWER64 for previewing, and another that enables quick previewing without the need for compiling.  By using these preview functions, you can verify the results of your editing while working on the NIFF file.</p>
