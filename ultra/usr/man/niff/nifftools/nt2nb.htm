</font></p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<blockquote>
    nt2nb input-file output-file
</blockquote>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

Reads the text file input-file and outputs it to the NIFF data file output-file.
<p>
This command can convert the data output in text format by nb2nt into NIFF binary data. 

<ul>
 <li> Everything below ";" is a comment and is thrown out when the file is read.
 <li> The read data is a list of integers and real numbers, but it corresponds to a list of NIFF binary data
 <li> If the list of numerical data is not wrong, then it does not matter whether the other character strings are correct or not.
 <li>If the first character in a string is - or 0~9, the string is judged to be numerical data.  After the string has been judged to be numerical data, it is read as "floating" if there is a decimal point.
 <li>The part bounded by &lt;List name&gt and &lt/List name&gt is read as that List, and it does not matter what is written outside of its delimiters.
</ul>

Basically, each numeric written in text format and delimited by spaces is converted into 4bytes of binary data.  Character strings that are not numerics are skipped.<p>
Texture data and NameList are not 4byte data, so these are given special treatment.  Please refer to the output of nb2nt.

<p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
If there are errors in the data list, sometimes the file cannot be converted.<br>
Because floating data is rounded off with nb2nt, you cannot be certain you have returned to the original data when using nt2nb.
