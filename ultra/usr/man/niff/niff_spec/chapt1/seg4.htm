As shown above, data created by the CG tool is converted to NIFF data.  This is processed using the NIFF editor, or it is converted directly from an unaltered form into game data using a converter.  The NIFF editor is a tool for editing binary NIFF data. It performs operations which are impossible to create with the CG tool.<BR>

In addition, while the converter is provided by Nintendo as a converter sample, it can be customized to yield data structures suitable for other types of game systems.  The API necessary for customization is supplied by Nintendo.
