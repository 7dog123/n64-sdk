<H3>3) Hierarchical Structure of 3D Objects</H3>

The objects in 3D games have a hierarchical structure, in many cases .  For instance, consider the example illustrated below.<BR>
<BR>

<I><B>Figure 9</B> -- Object with hierarchical structure</I><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="../img/NIFFspec-9.gif" ALT="Illustration" BORDER=0><BR>
<BR>

This example is an object comprised from 11 objects (hypothetically named Man_Object).  As an example, if the Man_Hip object in the above figure is the top level object, the links between the objects would be as shown below.<BR>
<BR>

<I><B>Figure 10</B> -- Hierarchical links in an object</I><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="../img/NIFFspec-10.gif" ALT="Illustration" BORDER=0><BR>
<BR>

In the case of the above figure, the origin of this Man_Object would be matched to the local coordinate system of the Man_Hip object.  However, since Man_Object would normally have its own local coordinate system, and it could be imagined that Man_Hip would be animated in that coordinate system, Man_Object is defined as a NULL object and is linked as shown below.<BR>
