<H2>2.2 Links to Nodes in NIFF</H2>

<H3>4) Object Hierarchical Links and Animation</H3>

Animation nodes are linked from each object node in NIFF data.  For instance, consider the hierarchical links of an object such as the arm illustrated below.<BR>
<BR>

<I><B>Figure 12</B> -- Three objects with a parent/child relationship</I><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="../img/NIFFspec-12.gif" ALT="Illustration" BORDER=0><BR>
<BR>

In this case, the hierarchical links between the objects from Obj_0 down and animation are as illustrated below.<BR>
<BR>

<I><B>Figure 13</B> -- Object hierarchical links and animation</I><BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="../img/NIFFspec-13.gif" ALT="Illustration" BORDER=0><BR>
<BR>

In other words, Obj_0 is animated with Anim_0 matrix data, Obj_1 is animated as the result of multiplying the matrix data Anim_0 and Anim_1, and Obj_2 is animated by multiplying the matrix data Anim_0, Anim_1, and Anim_2.
