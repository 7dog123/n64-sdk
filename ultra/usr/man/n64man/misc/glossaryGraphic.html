<FONT COLOR="0000A0"><H2>N64 Graphics Terminology</H2></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3>"A" value</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The alpha value.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Aliasing</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When you display lines or polygons using display equipment that has pixels (like TV), steps (notches) appear on diagonal and curved lines and polygon borders. Aliasing refers to these steps.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Alpha compare</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The process used to synthesize a translucent polygon drawing in pixels by comparing the alpha value of the pixel with a set threshold and using a conditional writing algorithm.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Alpha value</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The level of opacity. The larger the alpha value, the more opaque the image. In other words, the smaller the alpha value, the more transparent the image.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Ambient light</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The light that disperses into the environment with no direction. It determines the color of the part of the object that is not lit (that is, the part that has no directional light shining on it).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Anti-aliasing</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A technique used to smooth lines and image edges by reducing the jagged edges (notches) sometimes seen in bitmap images. This is accomplished by shading pixels along the edge with colors that are a blend of the adjacent colors. This feature is implemented in the N64 RCP graphics hardware.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Aperture or Field-of-view angle</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The angle that defines the visible area.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Bilinear filtering</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A process that provides bilinear interpolation for the color change of a texture so that texels (texture pixels) don't become large when the texture is extended.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Bilinear interpolation</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The two-dimensional linear interpolation provided in the vertical and horizontal directions. It is a technique used to improve the appearance of a textured surface when viewed at a given distance by blending the colors of adjacent texels. This feature is implemented in the N64 RCP graphics hardware.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Bilerp</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Short for "bilinear interpolation."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Bitmap</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Any image represented with pixels.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Blend color compare</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The alpha value (threshold) used in the alpha compare process.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Blend texture</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The texture used to determine the mixed ratio between the shading and texture RGB values when using the texture "A" value.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Blender</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The RDP component used to mix the calculated pixels and framebuffer pixels. The blender (BL) is used in translucent polygon drawing process, the anti-aliasing process, the fog process, the dither process, and so on.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Blender mux control bit</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The data used to set the blender hardware.  This data defines the blend expression. It is stored in the "othermode" parameter of the RDP.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Bounding volume test</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The test used for volume culling.  The test checks to see if the object is completely outside the viewing volume. If it is, display list items for that object are not executed, so processing speeds up.</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
<FONT SIZE=3>Box filter</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of the modes of the texture filter. It balances the four texels that lie around the sampling point. It is most effective when the sampling point is placed in the center of four texels.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Chroma-key process</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The process that sets a specific color (often blue) to be rendered as transparent and then synthesizes more than two images leaving out the parts that have the specific (blue) color.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>CI</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The color index texture type.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Clamp</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A technique that simply uses the edge data for the texture if you specify an area larger than the texture size.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Clipping</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The process that cuts off polygons or lines outside of the view in order to reduce the amount of data being processed during rendering. Although clipping takes a relatively long time to process, you can reduce the process time by changing the ratio between the clipping rectangle and screen, and then using clipping along with the faster process of scissoring.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Clipping pyramid or box</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The three-dimensional area outside of which clipping occurs. In other words, objects sticking out of this area are clipped.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Color buffer</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Color frame buffer, where drawing data is stored.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Coverage value</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The information about how much of a pixel is covered by a primitive. There are
16 subpixels for each pixel. It is used by the anti-aliasing process.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>CPU</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Central processing unit. The main processor in a computer, which in the case of the N64 is a MIPS 4000 series 64-bit processor operating at approximately 93 megahertz. This is very similar to the CPUs in the Silicon Graphics workstations.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Culling</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The process whereby unnecessary objects are culled (removed) from the display and from the graphic command pipeline (the display list). For example, the back of an object and objects out of view are culled from the display list.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>cvgbit</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The coverage value.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Detail texture </FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Even if you use tri-linear MIP map interpolation, the texture becomes blurry when it approaches the maximum level of MIP mapping. The detail texture shows the detail texture design when MIP mapping is unsuitable.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Diffuse light </FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Light that reflects in all directions with the same strength as opposed to reflecting light where the strength of reflecting light depends on the angle of incidence.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Display list</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The series of GBI commands needed for a drawing routine that provides all the necessary GBI commands each time without rerunning the routine. This makes the program simple, and ensures that the object will always be drawn the same way as quickly as possible.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Dither filter</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the 16-bit format, each color is allocated only 5 bits. So, to enhance the color data, a dither filter is applied to give each color 8 bits by adding correction data in a special pattern in the lowest 3 bit positions. This softens the mach band effect.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Dither matrix</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The correction data pattern for the low 3 bits used by the dither filter.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Dithering</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A technique used to enhance image quality by increasing the apparent number of colors beyond those that are actually used to display the image. Basically, a different but close color is specified by using neutral tints and placed here and there in the image. This feature is implemented in the N64 RCP graphics hardware as an implementation of the dither filter.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Double buffering</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A process that uses a pair of color frame buffers. One color frame buffer is used to display on the screen while the other is being rendered into. When drawing ends, the roles of the two buffers are exchanged. This technique provides smoother animation and higher frame rates.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Environment mapping</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A rendering technique used to create realistic-looking reflections on a suface. Reflections are everywhere in the real world but conspicuously absent from most video games due to the extremely high performance required to process reflections in real time. You can execute it easily in N64 development by using reflection mapping. This feature is implemented in the N64 RCP graphics hardware.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Fill rate</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The pixel drawing rate per second.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Flat shading</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To fill up an entire primitive with a single color.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Flip</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To move the texture by switching the coordinates such that the s coordinate goes to the y direction and the t coordinate goes to the x direction.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Flip book animation</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Animation that looks like a flip-book comic.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Fog process</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The process that makes far-away objects look misty or foggy to simulate normal atmospheric effects. This provides realistic views of objects in the distance. Thanks to this, even if the quality of the far-away object falls, the whole quality of the image is not affected as much. It also can be used to soften the pop-in or pop-out effect. This feature is implemented in the N64 RCP graphics hardware.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Frame buffer</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An area of RAM used to store the pixel data for a single screen image (frame).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Frame rate (FPS)</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The number of frames displayed per second (FPS). Higher frame rates provide for smoother motion. Broadcast video operates at 30 FPS. Movies are shown at 24 FPS. The N64 can support rates up to 60 FPS, much faster than videos or movies. The maximum is 60 FPS in the NTSC system and 50 FPS in PAL.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Gamma correction</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The correction of intensity changes that take into account the fact that the human eye responds to ratios of intensity rather than to absolute values of intensity. Therefore, intensity changes need to be spaced logarithmically rather than linearly to achieve equal steps in brightness. The characteristics of the CRT display are also taken into consideration when gamma correction occurs.<BR>
<BR>

The N64 has gamma correction hardware, and gamma correction is recommended; the antialiasing and video hardware work best when it is enabled.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Geometry</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The three-dimensional coordinate data or a graphic form created by it. It is much more efficient to use textures to create complex objects than it is to use geometry.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Geometry engine</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A system that executes numeric value calculations using three-dimensional coordinate information to create geometric objects.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Geometric primitive</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A basic geometric element of three-dimensional space. Primitives are combined to compose a complex and varied scenes. Examples include points, line segments, polygons, and any area enclosed by line segments.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Global state register</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The register that specifies the configuration and synchronization of the pipeline inside the RDP.  It sets the cycle type, the synchronization between the pipeline and the attributes, and the information about the atomic primitive mode.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Gouraud shading</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A shading technique named after the researcher who developed it. It is also known as "intensity interpolation shading" or "color interpolation shading" or simply "smooth shading." Using Gouraud shading an object is rendered with smoothly changing color across its face. Each vertex can have a unique color and they will be blended evenly between the vertices for reduced "banding" and enhanced realism. This is accomplished by collecting and interpolating each vertex color to eliminate intensity discontinuities and thus make vertices and edges inconspicuous so that a smooth curved surface is created. This feature is implemented in the N64 RCP graphics hardware.<BR>
<BR>

The cost of geometric processing in the RSP follows in order of decreasing performance:

<OL><LI>Flat shade
<LI>Gouraud shade
<LI>Gouraud shade + Z-Buffer
<LI>Gouraud shade + Texture
<LI>Gouraud shade + Z-Buffer + Texture</OL></BLOCKQUOTE>


<FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="GBI"></A>Graphic Binary Interface (GBI)</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The display list interface used to render graphics. Each command or single instruction in the display list is 64 bits in length. The GBI command string is called the display list.<BR>
<BR>

The CPU assembles the GBI structure in RDRAM for the RSP/RDP to render. The RSP must first download the graphics microcode in order to perform geometry transformation. The RDP performs polygon rasterization.

The graphics binary interface (GBI) contains many 3D graphics features. Following are the basic features of the GBI pipeline:<BR>

<FONT SIZE=3>Intersection mode</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A mode you can use when one surface is sticking into another surface.  you don't have to use this mode when objects intersect, but if you do, the intersection is correctly anti-aliased.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Inverse kinematics (IK)</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A modeling approach for showing objects in motion. It uses complex mathematical algorithms to move objects so that the motion appears normal. Kinematics refers to the positions and velocities of points in space. Inverse kinematics refers to the determination of how an object would move through space if x force is applied and the object is moving at y speed given the number, positions, and range of motion of the object's joints. It uses the principals governing the behavior of connected parts and joints. This approach is suitable for the animation of humans or animals.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Level of detail (LOD)</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The level of detail. Objects that are traveling fast or are far away can be rendered with much less detail without noticeable loss of quality. This greatly improves the drawing rate. This feature is implemented in the N64 RCP graphics hardware.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Material properties or characteristics</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Objects can be rendered more realistically if the properties or characteristics of the material are considered. For example, chalk tends to be dull whereas metal tends to be shiny. The reflection and transparency characteristics of an object's material can be mathematically expressed by using the following data:

<UL><LI>The reflection
<LI>The transparency
<LI>The object's internal color
<LI>The object's surface color
<LI>The object's density
<LI>The mirror face factor
<LI>The plane roughness factor

<FONT SIZE=3>Matrix</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Matrices are used to describe an object's position and direction in three-dimensional space.  Matrix calculations are used for coordinate transformations when rotating or moving an object in three-dimensional space and for projecting an object on the screen.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Matrix stack</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The stack used to implement complex matrix operations.  There are two types of stacks:  a 10-element modeling matrix stack to hold data relating to the object's position or direction and a 1-element viewing matrix stack to hold data relating to the viewing position or direction.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Mesh object</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The collection of vertices, lines, and triangle faces.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>MIP mapping</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A mapping (or filtering) technique for mapping textures onto polygons. MIP stands for multum in parvo, which means "many things in a small place." This technique improves the appearance of a textured surface by computing new textures to be displayed based on the distance of the object from the viewer. This can be used to prevent annoying noise or patterns from developing at certain distances, and it can be used to ensure that a texture viewed up close does not look like giant pixels. This feature is implemented in the N64 RCP graphics hardware.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The ability of a system that contains more than one processor to execute separate processes on each processor simultaneously. The N64 can execute separate processes on the CPU, RSP, and RDP simultaneously allowing it to draw pixels, produce audio, and respond to player input all at the same time. However only one process executes at one time on any one processor.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Multitasking</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The ability of an operating system to execute two or more processes simultaneously. The N64 operating system provides support for multitasking the RCP because the RCP contains two processors, the RDP and RSP. However only a single process executes at one time on any one processor. The current process has the full attention of the processor until that process yields.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Multithread programming</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A technique used to organize an application into logically separate programs called threads that execute simultaneously. The N64 software libraries and operating system provide support for a multithread-like operation on the CPU by using a preemptive priority system. However, no time slicing or round-robin scheduling is provided. The current process has the full attention of the CPU until it stops on its own or yields the CPU to a process that has a higher priority; that is, until the current process is preempted.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Near clipping </FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A technique that clips any object that lies closer than a certain distance from the viewer.

<BLOCKQUOTE>The basic elements (dots, lines, and polygons) to be used to draw 3D objects.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Quadtree</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A 2D representation format used to encode images. It uses binary subdivision to encode the image by successively subdividing a 2D plane to form quadrants. A quadtree that represents an area of the plane has quadrants that are either full (black), partially full (gray), or empty (white). The partially full quadrants are recursively subdivided until all quadrants are either full or empty.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A texture mapping method that dynamically calculates the texture coordinate that reflects into the position by using the normal vector of the reflection mapping object.  Used to show the surroundings reflecting on the object's surface.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Rendering </FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To convert a specified primitive to image data for the framebuffer.

<FONT SIZE=3>Sub-pixel</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A piece (1/16) of a pixel obtained when you split one pixel into 16 (4 by 4) sub-pixels. Sub-pixels are used to compute a coverage value.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Texel</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A point (pixel) within a texture map.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Texture map</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bitmapped pictures or patterns placed onto the surface of polygon.  It's simply called a texture.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Texture mapping</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The process of placing a bitmap image (a texture) onto the surface of a polygon during rendering. For example, placing a photograph of bricks onto a polygon to create the illusion of a brick wall. Texture mapping is essential to create realistic 3D worlds.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A technique that creates large textures by repeating a small texture over and over. If you use wrap, the texture size must be an exponent of 2.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>YUV</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The digital video signal standard consisting of the intensity (Y) and the color difference (UV) components. Because human eyes are not so sensitive to the color component, it decreases the sampling of the color component and provides effective compression. For example, it is used in MPEG animation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>YUV-RGB conversion</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The conversion from YUV to RGB provided by the texture filter and the color combiner.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT SIZE=3>Z-Buffer</FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A rendering technique where the distance from the viewer (Z) for each pixel is stored during rendering and used to determine which objects are displayed. If for instance, a pixel representing the dashboard of a car has already been drawn in a given location on the screen, then by comparing the distance from the viewer to the bumper to that of the dashboard, the program knows that the bumper should not be drawn over the top (in front) of the dashboard.  This feature is implemented in the N64 RCP graphics hardware.</BLOCKQUOTE>
