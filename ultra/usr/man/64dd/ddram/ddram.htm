<a name="1"><h1>1.	Purpose of This Program</h1></a>

<p>This program is designed for creating the N64 Disk Drive RAM image data as a file on the PC (a computer running under Windows 95).</p>

<p>The data in the RAM area of N64 Disk Drive can be managed with a file system.  With this program, you can use a PC file to create the image data for this file system.  </p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Main Window</strong>
  <dd>  The main window is used to perform such operations as copying files between the Disk Drive and the PC, deleting  files, creating directories, and changing entry attributes.

<a name="3-12"><h2>3-12. Reserving LBA</h2></a>

<p>To specify that the file system does not use a specified LBA, select "Reserve LBA" from the "Edit" menu to open the "LBA usage" window.  LBA is reserved in this window.  See section 4 for details.</p>

<hr>
<a name="3-13"><h2>3-13. Exiting the Program</h2></a>

<p>Click the X button in the upper-right corner of the main window or select "Exit" from the "File" menu.</p>

<hr>
<a name="4"><h1>4.Manipulating the "LBA Usage" Window</h1></a>

<p>When "Reserve LBA" is selected from the "Edit" menu in the main window, the window like that shown in Figure 4-1 appears.  This is called the "LBA Usage" window.  By manipulating this window, it is possible to prevent the File System from using a specified LBA.  The specification can also be canceled from this window. </p>

<p><a name="f4-1"><img alt="Figure 4-1.  The "LBA Usage" window" src="gifs/f0401.gif" width="552" height="426"></a><br>
<strong>Figure 4-1.  The "LBA Usage" window</strong></p>

<p>  Each colored square can be thought of as an LBA cell.  Each cell expresses one LBA, and the color of the cell indicates the current status of that LBA. </p>

<p>  White cells are LBA that are managed by the file system but have not been used yet.</p>

<p>  Green cells are LBA reserved by the user. </p>

<p>  Blue cells are LBA managed by the file system and already in use.</p>

<p>  Red cells are LBA for which access has been disabled due to disk damage, etc.   
       Naturally, cells of this color will not appear if this tool was used to create data from the start.
</p>

<p>  Light blue cells represent the selected area.   This will be explained in 4-1.</p>

<p>  The numbers down the  left side and along the top express the LBA in each LBA cell.  For example, the LBA in the LBA cell in row 1440, column 07 is LBA 1447. </p>

<p>  The cursor sits above one LBA cell at a time, and that cell is highlighted in reverse-color.  The cursor can be moved around using the keyboard arrow keys. </p>

<hr>
<a name="4-1"><h2>4-1. Selecting an Area</h2></a>

<p>  An entire area of LBA cells can be selected by pressing the Shift key while moving the cursor.  The cells from the starting position to the current position of the cursor will change color to light blue.  A light-blue cell is a selected cell, and in this state it can be reserved or unreserved.  To cancel the selection, release the Shift key and move the cursor. </p>

<hr>
<a name="4-2"><h2>4-2.	Reserving LBA</h2></a>

<p> When an LBA is reserved, the File System can no longer use that LBA.</p>

<p>  To reserve LBA, select the LBA cells (see section 4.1 above) and then select "Reserve" from the "Edit" menu.  The selected LBA are reserved and displayed in green.  When an LBA is not selected, the operation acts on the LBA cell above which the cursor is currently resting.  </p>

<p>Only LBA that are free and managed by the File System can be reserved with this operation.   If any other type of LBA is selected, nothing will happen.</p>

<hr>
<a name="4-3"><h2>4-3. Canceling an LBA Reservation</h2></a>

<p>Canceling the reservation on a reserved LBA enables the File System to use that LBA.</p>

<p>To do this,   select the LBA cell (see section 4-1) and then select "Free up" from the "Edit" menu.  The selected LBA reservation is canceled and the cell is displayed with white.  When an LBA is not selected, the operation acts on the LBA cell above which the cursor is currently resting.</p>

<p>Naturally, cancellations can only be made for LBA that are currently reserved. .   If a cancellation is attempted on any other type of LBA, nothing will happen.</p>

<hr>
<a name="5"><h1>5.	Precautions</h1></a>

<hr>
<a name="5-1"><h2>5-1. Operate Very Carefully</h2></a>

<p>The current version does not support the "Undo" function.  Since an entry that is accidentally deleted cannot be recovered, please operate this tool very carefully.  Also, because data is always saved to the original file during operations, you cannot "salvage" your work after making a mistake by closing the file without saving.  In fact, because changes are always saved to the file, there is no basic "Save" function.</p>

<p>For this reason, we recommend that you create a backup before you begin editing data.   Use Explorer of some such tool to create a copy of the image data file before you begin to work.  </p>

<p>Also, try not to edit an important file the first time you operate this tool.  It is better to start by creating a new file and practicing the basic operations there.</p>

<hr>
<a name="5-2"><h2>5-2. Do Not Open the Same File for Simultaneous Editing</h2></a>

<p>Please do not activate this program more than once and edit the same file in each program.  The file will lose consistency and the data will become corrupted.</p>
