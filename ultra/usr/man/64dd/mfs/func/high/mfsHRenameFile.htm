<p><strong>Format:</strong> s32 mfsHRenameFile(const u8*
oldname, const u8* newname)</p>

<p><strong>Arguments:</strong></p>

<p>*oldname File pathname to be changed<br>
*newname New file pathname</p>

<p><strong>Return value:</strong>Error</p>

<p><strong>Function:</strong> Renames file</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> This function changes the file name specified by oldname to newname.
When a drive name is assigned by newname, it must be the same as the drive name assigned by oldname.  
The directories of oldname and newname need not be the same.
If a different directory is specified, the file can be moved.
However, if file movement and renaming are performed at the same time, the file will be moved after it is renamed.  Therefore, if the oldname directory contains the same file name as the new file name, the name cannot be changed.</p>

<p><strong>Main errors:</strong></p>

<pre>MFS_ERR_NO	Normal termination

		The file attribute is write protected, or the volume attribute is write protected, or the parent directory is write protected.
MFS_ERR_NOTFOUND File not found
