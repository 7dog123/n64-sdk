<p><strong>Function:</strong>
Obtains update counter value of file or directory</p>

<p>Description: This function obtains and returns the update counter value of the file or directory specified by path.
Immediately after a file or directory is created, the update counter is set to 0.
Whenever data is written to a file or the attribute is changed, the update counter is incremented.  The maximum value is 255, and the value cannot be incremented above 255.
The update counter of the directory one level up is incremented at the same time.
The rewriting of a file by another drive can be detected by checking the update counter.</p>
