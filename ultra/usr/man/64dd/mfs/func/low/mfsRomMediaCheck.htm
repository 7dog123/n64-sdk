<pre>Format:	s32 mfsRomMediaCheck(void)
	s32 mfsRamMediaCheck(void)
Arguments:	None
Return value:Error
Function:	hecks medium
Description:	This function checks whether or not the medium has been formatted to MFS format.
When the medium has been formatted to MFS format, this function loads the header area into an internal buffer so that the disk can be accessed.
If a check has already been performed to determine whether or not the disk had been exchanged, mfsDiskldCheck should be called.   mfsDiskldCheck must also be called when an MFS_ERR_DEVICE error is returned from an MFS library function and the error is LEO_ERROR_MEDIUM_MAY_HAVE_CHANGE or LEO_ERROR_MEDIUM_NOT_PRESENT.

Main errors:
	MFS_ERR_NO	Normal termination
	MFS_ERR_DEVICE	Device error
                          An error occurred in an internally called Leo function.
Since a Leo function error is stored in the variable mfsError, check this variable to perform processing.  
	MFS_ERR_DISKCHANGE Media exchanged
                          The media has been replaced by another media.  
	MFS_ERR_NOTMFSDISK Not an MFS-format disk
                          The disk ID's disk use is not 1, or the header is different.
	MFS_ERR_VERSION	Different version disk 
	MFS_ERR_HEADER	Header error
                          The header area is corrupted.  If it is the RAM area, try to repair it.</pre>
