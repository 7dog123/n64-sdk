<pre>Format:	s32 mfsRamFlash(void)
Arguments:	None
Return value:Error
Function:	Writes header area
Description:	This function writes the header area to disk when the header area had been rewritten.
When an MFS library low-level function renames a file or directory or changes its size or attribute, a buffer held in memory is rewritten, and the data on disk is not rewritten.  This function writes multiple changes to disk at one time.
If no change has been made to the header area, nothing is written to disk.
This function should always be called after a series of disk manipulation functions.

Main errors:
	MFS_ERR_NO	Normal termination
	MFS_ERR_DEVICE	Device error
			An error occurred in an internally called Leo function.
Since a Leo function error is stored in the variable mfsError, check this variable to perform processing. 
	MFS_ERR_NOTMFSDISK Not an MFS-format disk
                          The disk ID's disk use is not 1, or the header is different.
	MFS_ERR_VERSION	Different version disk </pre>
