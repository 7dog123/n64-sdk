===============================                          (naudio.dev)

Summary:
-------
        n_audio library which was released as a patch for 2.0H was contained in Version 2.0I for RCP 2.0. 
         
         The directory structure under /usr/src/PR was changed completely and demo software is supposed to be installed in /usr/src/PR/demos.  Refer to /usr/src/PR/README.jp for other detailed structure.  Refer to /usr/src/PR/demos/README_DEMOS_NAUDIO.jp for description of each demo software. 

New functions:
-------------
         Refer to "Chapter 28 n_audio library" of the programming manual for details such as how to use n_audio library. 

New demo software:
-----------------
        playseq.naudio
        This is a sample program playseq which was changed to be compatible with n_audio.
        As a change from playseq_naudio, which was attached as a patch when released, a bug that Partner stops due to a large amount of error outputs when Partner is used, was fixed.              
         Other than that, this is same as the previous sample program playseq_naudio.   

Modified demo software:
----------------------

Modifications:
-------------
          The following changes were made to the header file, n_libaudio.h.    

        1.extern declaration related with n_audio micro code was included. Specifically, following two lines were added. 

        extern long long int    n_aspMainTextStart[], n_aspMainTextEnd[];
        extern long long int    n_aspMainDataStart[], n_aspMainDataEnd[];

        2.  A declaration of the function n_alSynFreeFX() was added.  However, it is not implemented like SGI audio library.            

        3.  A declaration of the function n_alSynSetFXtype() was deleted.  This is because the SGI audio library function alSynSetFXtype() which corresponds to this function does not exist, and also this function itself is incomplete.          
         
         Due to the above changes, the following changes were made to the header file, n_libaudio_s_to_n.h.  

        1.  A macro to convert the SGI audio library function alSynFreeFX() into n_audio library function n_alSynFreeFX() was added.  

        2.  A macro to convert the SGI audio library function alSynSetFXtype() into n_audio library function n_alSynSetFXtype() was deleted.
