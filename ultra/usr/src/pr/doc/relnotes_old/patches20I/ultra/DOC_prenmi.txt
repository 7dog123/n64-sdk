
       Regarding  osAfterPreNMI 


1. The Situation

   There was a bug that caused the application to stop when the Reset button was pressed when n_audio microcode was used in MPAL mode.


2. The Correction

        To correct the bug, the following functions were added:


        NAME
          osAfterPreNMI - Initializes the RSP program counter (PC).

        SYNOPSIS
          s32  osAfterPreNMI(void)

        DESCRIPTION
          When the application receives a pre-NMI, make sure to 
          stop all RSP tasks and then call this function.  

          If the function call succeeds, 0 is returned.
          If it fails, -1 is returned.  

          To play it safe, we recommend calling this function in modes 
          other than MPAL (NTSC, etc.) as well.
