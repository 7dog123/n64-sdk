1. Changes to Disk ID

	* The disk application Disk ID has been divided into a disk application
 	and a RAM area application.  The formats of the respective data are as 
	follows.  This table corresponds to the table printed on the first 
	page of "Chapter 6  Disk ID" in the "NINTENDO 64 Programming Manual." 

 | Offset    | Description           | Data Format | Details 
 |------------------------------------------------------------------------
 |   +6      | RAM Area Application  | Binary      | 0: General use
 |           |                       |             | 1: Nintendo Recommended 	File System
 |   +7      | Disk Application      | BCD         | 0: Game disk 
 |------------------------------------------------------------------------

	With this change, the Disk ID structure LEODiskID has been changed as 
	follows. 

        typedef struct
        {
          u8            gameName[4];
          u8            gameVersion;
          u8            diskNumber;
          u8            ramUsage;
          u8            diskUsage;
          LEOSerialNum  serialNumber;
          u8            company[2];
          u8            freeArea[6];
        } LEODiskID;


2. Changes to the Master Data Creation Tool n64mdisk
        	
	The following changes have been added to the master data creation tool 
	n64mdisk. 

	* RAM USE has been added to the master creation config file in order to
 	specify the RAM area application. 

                * RAM USE 
		Specifies disk application (2 hexadecimal digits or less).  0 
		indicates general use, 1 indicates that a Nintendo recomended 
		file system is being used. 

                        (Example)  RAM USE 0x0

                * DISK USE 
		Specifies disk application (2 decimal digits or less).  Specify 		0 for normal game disks. 

                        (Example)  DISK USE 0

	* The error which would occur when there was a blank line in a cfg file 
	has been corrected. 

	* The error which would set the free area to 0 when there was no line 
	feed code at the end of a file has been corrected. 

	* The version has been changed to 1.06.
