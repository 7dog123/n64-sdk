1. Purpose of This Patch

	This patch adds a new LEO_MOTOR_BRAKE mode to the existing 
	LeoSpdlMotor function. 


2. Changes to the LeoSpdlMotor Function

	Three different modes LEO_MOTOR_ACTIVE, LEO_MOTOR_STANDBY, and 
	LEO_MOTOR_STOP could be specified as modes with the old LeoSpdlMotor 
	function.  With this specification change, it will be possible to 
	specify a new LEO_MOTOR_BRAKE mode. 

	Forcibly stopping the disk by specifying the BRAKE mode with 
	LeoSpdlMotor has the following differences from allowing the disk to 
	stop naturally without specifying a mode (or stopping by specifying 
	the SLEEP mode). 

	(When BRAKE mode has been specified) 
	* The disk stops immediately (average 1.5 seconds, maximum 3 seconds). 
	* When disk stops, a small catching sound is emitted by the forced stop. 
	(When disk stops normally or when SLEEP mode has been specified)
	* It takes some time until the disk stops (average 3 seconds, maximum 
	6 seconds). 
	* Virtually no sound is emitted as the device just waits for the disk to
 	stop naturally. 


3. Using the BRAKE Mode 

	For example, when it is necessary to swap disks during a game, the need
 	arises to rapidly stop the disk which is currently rotating.  The BRAKE
 	mode is effective in this kind of situation. 
	Conversely, when the game is proceeding normally, it is more effective 
	to let the disk stop naturally by terminating read/write because of the
 	sound made by stopping the disk or because the need may arise to 
	read/write again by the time the disk stops. 


4. Precautions for this Patch 

	The reason that care is necessary when using this patch is that these 
	changes are only effective with the new type of drive. 
	The LEO_MOTOR_BRAKE mode is effective only with the new spec development
 	drive that was released and distributed in 1998.  Since forced stops are
 	always performed with the development drive released and distributed in
 	1997, even if the LEO_MOTOR_BRAKE mode is specified, the drive will 
	operate as though the LEO_MOTOR_SLEEP mode had been specified.  
	(However, the oldest type of drive is not forcibly stopped and, 
	conversely, always waits for the disk to stop.) 
	It is possible to check the drive with the LeoInquiry function to 
	determine whether you have an old or a new type of drive.  This value 
	will be 0x14 for the new drive, while the value will be 0x4 for the old
 	drive.  
	Now, all of the commercially available mass-produced drives are new 
	specification drives which are compatible with the BRAKE mode. 
	Even if this patch is installed in an environment in which an old drive
 	is being used, there will not be any problems since the mode 
	specification will not have any meaning.
