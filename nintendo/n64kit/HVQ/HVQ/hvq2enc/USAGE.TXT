Still image compression tool hvq2enc version 2.6

Instruction Manual
================================================================


Introduction
============

hvq2enc is a still image compression tool that uses the HVQ2 method to compress 
image data.  
   
HVQ2 is a proprietary still image encoding method developed by Hudson.  The method 
is like JPEG, in that the image cannot be directly decompressed (i.e., the data 
cannot be completely restored to its original form), but the quality of the 
regenerated image can be adjusted by changing the compression parameters.  The 
higher the quality of the regenerated image, the lower the extent of image 
compression.  Conversely, the higher the compression ratio, the lower the quality 
of the regenerated image.

This relationship between compression ratio and image quality is the same or 
better with HVQ2 compared to JPEG, and it outshines JPEG when it comes to images 
that have distinct outlines and text.  Moreover, HVQ2 can decode compressed data 
faster than JPEG software.



4:1:1 mode and 4:2:2 mode
=========================

HQV2 presently offers two types of encoding: a 4:1:1 mode and a 4:2:2 mode.

The 4:1:1 mode provides slightly lower color quality (fidelity) than the 4:2:2 
mode, but offers more effective compression and faster decoding.  And in any event, 
the difference in color fidelity is virtually indistinguishable, subjectively.

hvq2enc supports both modes.



hvq2enc Operating Environment
=============================

hvq2enc is a command that runs from the MS-DOS prompt of Windows 95.


How to Use hvq2enc
==================

The tool is used in the following way:

     hvq2enc [-q thr] [-s type] [-o image-output] image_input code_output

Specify the path for the input image file in the argument image_input.  The input 
image file can take any of the following formats: 


     * Windows or OS/2 1.x bitmap format (BMP/DIB)
        (However, no support for the compressed format (RLE))


     * PPM (Portable Pixelmap) ASCII format and raw format

The format of the input image file is determined automatically from the contents 
of the file.

The horizontal pixel count of the input image must be an integer multiple of 8.  
The vertical pixel count of the image file must be an integer multiple of 8 if the 
-s 1 option is specified (the default), or an integer multiple of 4 if the -s 2 
option is specified.  If the input file does not conform to these rules, any 
excess at the bottom or the right side of the image will be automatically cut off.

The compressed data (the HVQ2 file) will be written to the path specified by the 
code_output argument.  If a file already exists with that name, it will be 
overwritten, so be careful when specifying the path.


The following optional arguments are available: 

    -q thr

     Specify an integer of 0 or greater.  The greater the value, the higher the 
     compression ratio but the lower the quality of the decoded image.  Conversely, 
     the smaller the value, the higher the quality of the image but the larger the 
     size of the encoded file and the more time it takes to compress.  When the -q 
     option is not specified, the default value of thr is 800. 

    -s type

     When 1 is specified for type, the image is compressed in 4:1:1 mode.  When 2 
     is specified, it is compressed in 4:2:2 mode.  When the -s option is not 
     specified, the default type is 1.


    -o image_output

     The decoded image file is output to the path specified by image_output.  If a 
     file already exists with that name, it will be overwritten, so please be 
     careful.  When the path specified by image_output ends with ".bmp" (case 
     insensitive), the output file takes on the OS2 bit map format (uncompressed, 
     24bit/pixel).  Otherwise, it takes on the PPM (Portable Pixelmap) raw format.


HVQ2 File Format
================

hvq2enc version 2.6 outputs the compressed data to a file in the "HQV2 1.0" format 
described below:



"HVQ2 1.0" file header
----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Offset    Size        Explanation
  (bytes)   (bytes)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    +0        16     File version (*1)
   +16         4     File size (*2)(*5)
   +20         1     Color difference component - horizontal 
                     sampling rate (*3)
   +21         1     Color difference component - vertical
                     sampling rate (*4)
   +22         2     Number of pixels in horizontal direction (*5)
   +24         2     Number of pixels in vertical direction (*5)
   +26         6     Encoding parameter (*6)
   +32         4     Required number of FIFO packets for 2-pass decoding (*5)
   +36        54     Section offset table (*6)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*1  "HVQ2 1.0" is stored with a ASCIIZ character string.
*2  The file size must be an integer multiple of 4.
*3  Must be 2 for HVQ2 1.0 
*4  2 for 4:1:1 mode, and 1 for 4:2:2 mode.
*5  The big endian method is used for this data.
*6  Not disclosed.



Notes
=====

In general, the smaller the size of the image, the lower the compression 
efficiency.  An extremely small image may not even be compressed.


Main changes from version 2.5
=============================

-- Fixed the problem regarding incorrect input of 16bit color Windows bitmap files.
