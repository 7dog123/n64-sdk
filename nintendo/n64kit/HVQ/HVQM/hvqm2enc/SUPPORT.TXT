
Converting from AVI to HVQM

1  As an option, you can change the compression rate, etc. Adjust this accordingly.
   If you are converting actual film footage, note that it is not practical to set 
   the value of the -q option below 200, since the compression process will take 
   time and the compression ratio will decline. 
   Also, you need to consider the frame rate for the original data being captured 
   so frames are not dropped out on the N64.  Please use the -k option to match 
   the key frame interval at compression time with the frame rate of the original 
   data. 

2  When getting actual film footage taken with a digital camera, etc. by capturing
   it, you must set it up to only get odd or even frames in NTSC format or the 
   quality will not be sufficient.
