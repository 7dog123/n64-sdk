Editor's Comments

The bath mat and towel has the same texture but is made to appear differently with 
CC configuration. 

The water in the shower is scaled after applying on Alfa Channel. Also, the image 
of the texture is altered by lighting. The common materials are edited through 
NIFF EDITOR.
