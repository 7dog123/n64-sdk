Editor's Comments: 
The wing consists of two textures with different RenderTypes. The tip of the wing 
can not be identified with NiffEditor because the scale texture and the gradation 
are drawn through the Alfa channel with PhotoShop. The shadow on the belly is 
colored the same as the top color.
