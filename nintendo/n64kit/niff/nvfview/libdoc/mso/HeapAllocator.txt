Function 
-  Allocates heap memory for multi-thread applications. 

Functions 
-  void msoHeapAllocatorInit( MsoHeapAllocator *allocator_ptr, void *heap_ptr,
                             const u32 size );
  Initializes MsoHeapAllocator.  heap_ptr is the head of the heap area and size is its size. 

Precautions 
-  Thread ID
  The Thread ID must be unique for the system.  This is because MsoHeapAllocator identifies the thread 
  which is requesting memory allocation by its ID. 

-  Ownership of allocated memory
  Memory is owned by the thread that requested that allocation.  It may be accessed by other threads, but 
  that memory can be released only by the thread that owns it.
