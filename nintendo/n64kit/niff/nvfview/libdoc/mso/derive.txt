Function 
-  Macro group for simple installation of an object succession. 

Macro 
-  _msoDeriveFrom( basetype )
  Defines the base member.  The name of the base member is, e.g., _baseMxxObject for the MxxObject 
  format.  This is used in the structure. 

-  _msoBaseOffset( basetype, drvtype )
  Returns the offset of the base member in u8 units. 

-  _msoDownCast( drvtype, basetype, ptr )
  Casts the base type pointer "ptr" to the pointer for the derivative type "drvtype". 

-  _msoUpCast( basetype, ptr )
  Casts the derivative type pointer "ptr" to the base type pointer. 

Usage Example 
-  Derive MxxResource from MxxObject as follows. 
  typedef struct _MxxResource
  {
    _msoDeriveFrom( MxxObject );
    ....
  } MxxResource;

-  Obtain the pointer for the derivative type MxxResource from the base type MxxObject as follows. 
  res_ptr = _msoDownCast( MxxResource, MxxObject, obj_ptr );

-  Conversely, obtain the pointer for the base type MxxObject from the derivative type MxxResource as 
   follows. 
  obj_ptr = _msoUpCast( MxxObject, res_ptr );
