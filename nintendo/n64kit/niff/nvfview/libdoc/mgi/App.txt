(  Basic function of application program

Functions 
(  void mgiAppInit( const u32 frame_latency,
                   	   const u32 gfx_length,
                   	   const u32 frame_resource_size,
                   	   const u32 instance_queue_size,
                   	   const u32 max_modules,
		   const u32 transform_buffer_size,
                   	   void *user_data )
  Initialize the application. 
  - frame_latency is determined by Nusystem. 
    Double buffer:  frame_latency = 2
    Triple buffer:  frame_latency = 3
  - gfx_length is the size of the gfx buffer, and the actual capacity of the gfx buffer is 
    frame_latency * gfx_length * sizeof( Gfx ). 
  - frame_resource_size sets the frame resource capacity of the scene. 
    Frame resource is the temporary storage area used for rendering each frame, and is discarded when 
    frame rendering is completed.  For example, it is for recording Mtx, and dynamically, Vtx. 
  - instance_queue_size sets the maximum number of queues necessary during hierarchy evaluation. 
  - max_modules sets the maximum number of modules used by the application. 
  - transform_buffer_size sets the maximum capacity of the coordinate conversion buffer needed during 
    hierarchy evaluation. 

(  void mgiAppMainLoop( void )
  Enters the main loop.  This loop does not end. 

(  void mgiAppAddRenderJob( MgiJob *job_ptr )
  Adds a render job.  A render job only executes the frame after rendering has been completed.  Render 
  jobs are executed in the order that they were added. 

(  void mgiAppInsertRenderJob( MgiJob *new_job_ptr, MgiJob *job_ptr )
  Inserts a render job in front of a job which has already been added. 

(  void mgiAppRemoveRenderJob( MgiJob *job_ptr )
  Cancels a render job. 

(  void mgiAppAddFrameJob( MgiJob *job_ptr )
  Adds a frame job.  A frame job executes each frame even if rendering is not completed.  Frame jobs are
  executed in the order that they were added. 

(  void mgiAppInsertFrameJob( MgiJob *new_job_ptr, MgiJob *job_ptr )
  Inserts a frame job in front of a job which has already been added. 

(  void mgiAppRemoveFrameJob( MgiJob *job_ptr )
  Cancels a frame job. 

Global Variables 
(  gMgiApp
  This is the actual application itself.  A pointer to MgiApp is not specified in the argument of mgpApp*() because all functions access this global variable. 

Macros 
(  _mgiAppAddCharacter( char_ptr )
  Adds an MgiCharacter job as a render job. 

(  _mgiAppGetHierarchy( )
  Returns a pointer to the scene hierarchy. 

(  _mgiAppGetScene( )
  Returns a pointer to the scene.
