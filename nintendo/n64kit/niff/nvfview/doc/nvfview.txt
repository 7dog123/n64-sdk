[main.c Functions]
resetreg( ):
    Initializes nvfview settings. 

callback( ):
    Callback to call each frame.  Primarily performs menu and mode control. 

setup_allocator( ):
    Initializes memory allocation.  The initialization method differs for 4M and 8M memories. 

mainproc( ):
    Initializes the system and enters the main loop. 

[mainproc( ) Flow]
  1. Initialize Allocator.  ( setup_allocator( ) )
  2. Initialize application.  ( mgiAppInit( ) etc.)
  3. Initialize rendering group.  (Currently, perform this the same as main.c.  In the future, there will be a 
      greater variety of groups.) 
  4. Load the scene.  ( LoadScene( ) )
  5. Register the characters or jobs. 
      Characters and jobs are used to generate call backs. 
  6. Move to the main loop.  From this point on, only call backs are executed.
