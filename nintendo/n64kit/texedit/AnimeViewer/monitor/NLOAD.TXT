                         nload/nload.exe for DD
                          User Manual

Introduction
______________________________________________________________________________

With DD emulation, extension and options are added to the previous version of 
nload.
 
Arguments for application
______________________________________________________________________________

An application displays its usage by the addition of "-h" as an argument.
Options (-d,-x,-y,-D) have been added for DD support.  The basic option used to 
run the DD software is %nload -d.

%

The following is a description of the arguments. 

-s  
Specifies load (save) start address. Default is 0. The address must be an even 
number.

-l  
Specifies load size. Default at the time of loading is file size, and there is 
no need to specify.Default at the time of saving is 16MB. 

-r  
Specifies when you only want to reset in case downloading is done already. When 
this command is specified,  any other command is invalid.

-v  
Mode for detailed display.  Displays the status of downloading, too.

-n  
If not specified, it will go to a debug print loop after downloading. If 
specified, nload will end after downloading and execution. 

-h  
Displays usage.

-w  
Outputs the contents of NINTENDO64 to a file. If not specified, downloading from 
a file will be executed. 

-e  
Resets after downloading.  If specified, reset will not be done.

-b  
Sets debug communication address. The address needs to be specified by 4KB unit. 
(like being masked by 0xfffff000)  Default is 0xb1ff0000. (The last 64KB of 32MB)

-z  
Sets debug communication size.  The size needs to be specified by 4KB unit. 
Default is 0x10000.  The debug communication address and the debug communication
end address (the debug communication address and the debug communication size) 
must not be over 64KB segment.  (For example,  0xble08000 ~ 0xble18000 must not 
be specified.)

-I
Specifies SCSI host adapter and SCSI-ID to be used.  If default,  SCSI-ID will be 
detected automatically from SCSI device which is connected, however, it is also 
possible to specify SCSI-ID directly. (For example, if -i04, adapter=0 and ID=4) 

-d
Invokes DD emulation. Immediately following this option, the address of a buffer 
for DD communications can be specified. The default buffer is 
0xb1fe0000-0xb1feffff  (last 32 MB). This usually does not need to be changed. 

-x  
Specifies a 64MB disk image file.  The default is the current 'isvfile.'

-y  
Specifies the root directory when the host file system is used. 

-M  
IS-VIEWER64 automatically downloads a file used with makemask6102 when the 
starting address is 0 (0xb0000000).  makemask is not used when this option is 
specified. 

-D  
Specifies an IPL file for DD. The default is 'isvipl'. The file is transferred 
from 0xb000000 of the Game Pak to the 0x400000 area.  Currently, DD + Game Pak 
development is not supported.  Future improvements will allow the transfer 
address to be specified.

-N  
Specifying a device name immediately following this option permits the device to 
be used. If the device is not IS-VIEWER64, proper operation cannot be guaranteed.

-q  
Specifies the -d quick-start mode. Normally with DD emulation, the user program 
is loaded when the N cube screen is displayed and the A Button pressed.  With 
this option, the user program is executed at startup without waiting for the 
N cube and A Button. Using this together with the -R option explained below can 
further reduce startup time.

-R  
Use the internal DD-ROM (double-connector cartridge) for FONT and WAVE data 
access.  This is intended to limit the IPL file read at startup to the minimum 
necessary, thereby reducing startup time.  Note that the source file first must 
be edited to change osEPiStartDmaEmu() to osEPiStartDma().  Using this option 
together with the -q option allows faster startup of the user program.


Examples of Usage
______________________________________________________________________________

nload -v -d         
After the rom transfer, enter a loop for DD emulation and debugging.

nload -d -x ../disk2/isvfile
Same as above except that a disk image is specified.


nload -v -d0xb3fe0000
Same as the first example except that this sets the DD communication address to 
0xb3fe0000.

nload -v -d -q -R   
Use internal DD-ROM.  Specifies that the user program is to be executed 
immediately after startup.  This can be used to save time when the user 
application is debugged repeatedly.

Notes and Miscellaneous Items
______________________________________________________________________________

* The ISV Pak must be modified for DD emulation.  The previous Pak cannot be 
used.

* When the nload -d option is specified, isvipl (the IPL for DD) is read.  To 
execute the application from the IPL, press the START Button.
