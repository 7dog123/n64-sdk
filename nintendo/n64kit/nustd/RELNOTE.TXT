History of Revisions to the Standard Function Library (libnustd.a)

Revisions from V1.2(Jul 13 1999)
* Added #pragma intrinsic of math.h to sqrt, fabs, and fabsf.
  For IRIX6.2 and higher these functions are in-line expansion functions.

Revision from V1.1 (May 11, 1999)
* malloc() function familiy provides a new set of functions that 
  support multi-threading. 'mt_' is added to the front of the original 
  functions. However, multi-thread support has not been applied to InitHeap() 
  because it wouldn't make a significant improvement.

* The source code for the malloc() function family is separately provided
  for each function. (mt_)mallocmemdsp() is also included in the library
  release version (libnustd.a) because it won't be linked unless 
  the user uses it.

* malloc() and free() are changed to _malloc() and _free() where those 
  functions are called within realloc(), calloc(), and memalign().

* malloc_st_ptr has been removed because it does not need to be an 
  external variable. This variable is defined as an auto variable 
  within realloc(), which is the only function that refers this 
  variable.

* Fixed a problem where the address of the next block was 
  miscalculated when trying to change the block size without changing 
  the current pointer in realloc().

* In modff() and powf(), some values were cast with double where float 
  should have been used. These have been fixed. Now float is used to 
  cast values where it is appropriate.

* mt_qsort() has been provided to support multi-thread for qsort(). 

* Fixed a problem in acosf() where atan2(x, z) was used instead 
  of atan2f(x, z). 

* The functions that are also included in N64OS have been renamed. The 
  resulting names start with '_n'.


Error correction of README.TXT (July 11, 1998)
* Library to be specified when creating ROM version was wrong.
    (wrong) -lultra    (right) -lultra_rom
    (wrong) -lgultra   (right) -lgultra_rom

Changes since V1.0 (Dec 20, 1997)
* Added stblib.h, in essence moving the functions defined with this 
  header.
* Fixed the sequential search using bsearch.
* Fixed the problems with the div, ldiv, fmod, and fmodf functions.
* Added the isspace macro.
* Permitted  -1 in the isXXX argument.
* Changed the atof, atoi, atol, strtod, strtol, and strtoul functions 
  for isspace to use and read out header white space.
* Fixed problem with qsort function.
* Made some improvements to rand function.
