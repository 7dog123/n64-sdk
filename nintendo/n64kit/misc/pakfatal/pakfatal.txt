[1] About the program

This program fills the contents of the Controller Pak (and at least, the 
management area) with 0xff.  Please use this program for Controller Pak repair 
checks.

[2] How to use the program

Since pakfatal is a ROM file, with the Indy emulator board you would load using:

       %gload pakfatal.n64

while with the Partner-N64 you would load with a lp command:
        
       >lp pakfatal


Once this is loaded, execute the program after inserting the Controller Pak whose 
management area you want to over-write into Controller 1.  Press the A Button.


[3] Screen display

      Status: OK
              A normal Controller Pak is inserted in Controller 1.
              By pushing the A Button you can fill the memory region with 0xff.

      Status: NO PAK
              Nothing is inserted into Controller 1            

      Status: BROKEN or OTHER DEVICE
              Either a Controller Pak with a damaged memory region or some
              other device (Rumble Pak, etc) is inserted in Controller 1.

      Done: ???[%]
            Indicates the percentage of the Controller Pak filled with 0xff.
            This is reset when a normal Controller Pak is inserted.
